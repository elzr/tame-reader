<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<ul class="p" id="para-1">
	<li class="s" id="para-1_1">All known cognitive agents are collective intelligences, because we are all made of parts; biological agents in particular are not just structurally modular, but made of parts that are themselves agents in important ways.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_2">There is no truly monadic, indivisible yet cognitive being: all known minds reside in physical systems composed of components of various complexity and active behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_3">However, as human adults, our primary experience is that of a centralized, coherent Self which controls events in a top-down manner.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_4">That is also how we formulate models of learning (“the <i>rat</i> learned X”), moral responsibility, decision-making, and valence: at the center is a subject which has agency, serves as the locus of rewards and punishments, possesses (as a single functional unit) memories, exhibits preferences, and takes actions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_5">And yet, under the hood, we find collections of cells which follow low-level rules <i>via</i> distributed, parallel functionality and give rise to emergent system-level dynamics.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_6">Much as single celled organisms transitioned to multicellularity during evolution, the single cells of an embryo construct <i>de novo</i>, and then operate, a unified Self during a single agent’s lifetime.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_7">The compound agent supports memories, goals, and cognition that belongs to that Self and not to any of the parts alone.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_8">Thus, one of the most profound and far-reaching questions is that of scaling and unification: how do the activities of competent, lower-level agents give rise to a multiscale holobiont that is truly more than the sum of its parts? And, given the myriad of ways that parts can be assembled and relate to each other, is it possible to define ways in which truly diverse intelligences can be recognized, compared, and understood?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-2">
	<li class="s" id="para-2_1">Here, I develop a framework to drive new theory and experiment in biology, cognition, evolution, and biotechnology from a multi-scale perspective on the nature and scaling of the cognitive Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_2">An important part of this research program is the need to encompass beings beyond the familiar conventional, evolved, static model animals with brains.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_3">The gaps in existing frameworks, and thus opportunities for fundamental advances, are revealed by a focus on plasticity of existing forms, and the functional diversity enabled by chimeric bioengineering.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_4">To illustrate how this framework can be applied to unconventional substrates, I explore a deep symmetry between behavior and morphogenesis, deriving hypotheses for dynamics that up- and down-scale Selves within developmental and phylogenetic timeframes, and at the same time strongly impact the speed of the evolutionary process itself (<a href="#B106">Dukas, 1998</a>). I attempt to show how anatomical homeostasis can be viewed as the result of the behavior of the swarm intelligence of cells, and provides a rich example of how an inclusive, forward-looking technological framework can connect philosophical questions with specific empirical research programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-3">
	<li class="s" id="para-3_1">The philosophical context for the following perspective is summarized in <a href="#T1">Table 1</a> (see also <a href="#S12">Glossary</a>), and links tightly to the field of basal cognition (<a href="#B38">Birch et al., 2020</a>) <i>via</i> a fundamentally gradualist approach.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_2">It should be noted that the specific proposals for biological mechanisms that scale functional capacity are synergistic with, but not linearly dependent on, this conceptual basis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_3">The hypotheses about how bioelectric networks scale cell computation into anatomical homeostasis, and the evolutionary dynamics of multi-scale competency, can be explored without accepting the “minds everywhere” commitments of the framework.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_4">However, together they form a coherent lens onto the life sciences which helps generate testable new hypotheses and integrate data from several subfields.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="table" id="table-1">
	<li class="s" id="table-1_1"><strong><span class="caps">TABLE</span> 1.</strong> The core tenets of <span class="caps">TAME</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_2">Continuum of cognitive capacities &#8211; no binary categories, no bright line separating true cognition from &#8220;just physics,&#8221; as is clear from evolutionary process and ability to bioengineer chimeras between any two &#8220;natural kinds.&#8221;</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_3">Mature frameworks must apply to truly diverse intelligences — beyond the examples from Earth&#8217;s phylogenetic tree based on brains, we must be able to consider and compare agents across the option space of designed and evolved combinations of living, non-living, and software components at all scales.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_4">Selves exist across a continuum of persuadability, and it is an empirical question as to where on this axis any given system lies (revealed by the ratio of prediction and control vs. effort and knowledge that needs to be input, for any given way of relating to that system).</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_5">Selves are not fixed, permanent agents &#8211; their substrate can remodel radically during their lifetime; the owner of memories and preferences, and the subject that interprets rewards and punishments, is malleable and plastic.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_6">The core of being a Self is the ability to pursue goals. Selves can be nested and overlapping, cooperating and competing both laterally and across levels.  Each higher-level self deforms the option space for the lower level Selves, enabling them to follow energy minimization to achieve outcomes that look inevitable and simple at one scale, while serving intelligent goals at a higher scale.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_7">Intelligence is the degree of competency of navigating any space (not just the familiar 3D space of motility), including morphospace, transcriptional space, physiological space, etc., toward desirable regions, while avoiding being trapped in local minima. Estimates of intelligence of any system are observer-dependent, and say as much about the observer and their limitations as they do about the system itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-4">
	<li class="s" id="para-4_1">For the purposes of this paper, “cognition” refers not only to complex, self-reflexive advanced cognition or metacognition, but is used in the less conservative sense that recognizes many diverse capacities for learning from experience (<a href="#B145">Ginsburg and Jablonka, 2021</a>), adaptive responsiveness, self-direction, decision-making in light of preferences, problem-solving, active probing of their environment, and action at different levels of sophistication in conventional (evolved) life forms as well as bioengineered ones (<a href="#B314">Rosenblueth et al., 1943</a>; <a href="#B214">Lyon, 2006</a>; <a href="#B29">Bayne et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#B206">Levin et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#B216">Lyon et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). For our purposes, cognition refers to the functional computations that take place between perception and action, which allow the agent to span a wider range of time (<i>via</i> memory and predictive capacity, however much it may have) than its immediate <i>now</i>, which enable it to generalize and infer patterns from instances of stimuli—precursors to more advanced forms of recombining concepts, language, and logic.</li>

	<li class="s" id="figure-1_4">&lpar;C&rpar; At each layer of a given biosystem, novel components can be introduced of either biological or engineered origin, resulting in chimeric forms that have novel bodies and novel cognitive systems distinct from the typical model species on the Earth’s phylogenetic lineage.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-5">
	<li class="s" id="para-5_1">The framework, <span class="caps">TAME</span>—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—adopts a practical, constructive engineering perspective on the optimal place for a given system on the continuum of cognitive sophistication.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_2">This gives rise to an axis of <i>persuadability</i> (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>), which is closely related to the Intentional Stance (<a href="#B94">Dennett, 1987</a>) but made more explicit in terms of functional engineering approaches needed to implement prediction and control in practice.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_3">Persuadability refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_4">The origin story (designed vs. evolved), composition, and other aspects are not definitive guides to the correct level of agency for a living or non-living system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_5">Instead, one must perform experiments to see which kind of intervention strategy provides the most efficient prediction and control (thus, one aim should be generalizing the human-focused Turing Test and other IQ metrics into a broader agency detection toolkit, which perhaps could itself be implemented by a useful algorithm).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="figure" id="figure-2">
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_1"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The axis of persuadability.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_2">A proposed way to visualize a continuum of agency, which frames the problem in a way that is testable and drives empirical progress, is <i>via</i> an “axis of persuadability”: to what level of control (ranging from brute force micromanagement to persuasion by rational argument) is any given system amenable, given the sophistication of its cognitive apparatus? Here are shown only a few representative waypoints.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_3">On the far left are the simplest physical systems, e.g., mechanical clocks (A). These cannot be persuaded, argued with, or even rewarded/punished—only physical hardware-level “rewiring” is possible if one wants to change their behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_4">On the far right (D) are human beings (and perhaps others to be discovered) whose behavior can be radically changed by a communication that encodes a rational argument that changes the motivation, planning, values, and commitment of the agent receiving this.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_5">Between these extremes lies a rich panoply of intermediate agents, such as simple homeostatic circuits (B) which have setpoints encoding goal states, and more complex systems such as animals which can be controlled by signals, stimuli, training, etc., &lpar;C&rpar;.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_6">They can have some degree of plasticity, memory (change of future behavior caused by past events), various types of simple or complex learning, anticipation/prediction, etc.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_7">Modern “machines” are increasingly occupying right-ward positions on this continuum (<a href="#B47">Bongard and Levin, 2021</a>). Some may have preferences, which avails the experimenter of the technique of rewards and punishments—a more sophisticated control method than rewiring, but not as sophisticated as persuasion (the latter requires the system to be a logical agent, able to comprehend and be moved by arguments, not merely triggered by signals). Examples of transitions include turning the sensors of state outward, to include others’ stress as part of one’s action policies, and eventually the meta-goal of committing to enhance one’s agency, intelligence, or compassion (increase the scope of goals one can pursue). A more negative example is becoming sophisticated enough to be susceptible to a “thought that breaks the thinker” (e.g., existential or skeptical arguments that can make one depressed or even suicidal, Gödel paradoxes, etc.)—massive changes can be made in those systems by a very low-energy signal because it is treated as information in the context of a complex host computational machinery.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_8">These agents exhibit a degree of multi-scale plasticity that enables informational input to make strong changes in the structure of the cognitive system itself.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_9">The positive flip side of this vulnerability is that it avails those kinds of minds with a long term version of free will: the ability through practice and repeated effort to change their own thinking patterns, responses to stimuli, and functional cognition.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_10">This continuum is not meant to be a linear <i>scala naturae</i> that aligns with any kind of “direction” of evolutionary progress—evolution is free to move in any direction in this option space of cognitive capacity; instead, this scheme provides a way to formalize (for a pragmatic, engineering approach) the major transitions in cognitive capacity that can be exploited for increased insight and control.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_11">The goal of the scientist is to find the optimal position for a given system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_12">Too far to the right, and one ends up attributing hopes and dreams to thermostats or simple AIs in a way that does not advance prediction and control.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_13">Too far to the left, and one loses the benefits of top-down control in favor of intractable micromanagement.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_14">Note also that this forms a continuum with respect to how much knowledge one has to have about the system’s details in order to manipulate its function: for systems in class A, one has to know a lot about their workings to modify them.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_15">For class B, one has to know how to read-write the setpoint information, but does not need to know anything about how the system will implement those goals.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_16">For class C, one doesn’t have to know how the system modifies its goal encodings in light of experience, because the system does all of this on its own—one only has to provide rewards and punishments.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_17">Images by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-6">
	<li class="s" id="para-6_1">Our capacity to find new ways to understand and manipulate complex systems is strongly related to how we categorize agency in our world.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_2">Newton didn’t invent two terms—gravity (for terrestrial objects falling) and perhaps <i>shmavity</i> (for the moon)—because it would have lost out on the much more powerful unification.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_3"><span class="caps">TAME</span> proposes a conceptual unification that would facilitate porting of tools across disciplines and model systems.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_4">We should avoid quotes around mental terms because there is no absolute, binary distinction between <i>it knows</i> and <i>it “knows”</i>—only a difference in the degree to which a model will be useful that incorporates such components.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-7">
	<li class="s" id="para-7_1">Given this perspective, below I develop hypotheses about invariants that unify otherwise disparate-seeming problems, such as morphogenesis, behavior, and physiological allostasis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_2">I take goals (in the cybernetic sense) and stressors (as a system-level result of distance from one’s goals) as key invariants which allow us to study and compare agents in truly diverse embodiments.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_3">The processes which scale goals and stressors form a positive feedback loop with modularity, thus both arising from, and potentiating the power of, evolution.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_4">These hypotheses suggest a specific way to understand the scaling of cognitive capacity through evolution, make interesting predictions, and suggest novel experimental work.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_5">They also provide ways to think about the impending expansion of the “space of possible bodies and minds” <i>via</i> the efforts of bioengineers, which is sure to disrupt categories and conclusions that have been formed in the context of today’s natural biosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-8">
	<li class="s" id="para-8_1">What of consciousness? It is likely impossible to understand sentience without understanding cognition, and the emphasis of this paper is on testable, empirical impacts of ways to understand cognition in all of its guises.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_2">By enabling the definition, detection, and comparison of cognition and intelligence, in diverse substrates beyond standard animals, we can enhance the range of embodiments in which sentience may result.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_3">In order to move the field forward <i>via</i> empirical progress, the focus of most of the discussion below is on ways to think about cognitive function, not on phenomenal or access consciousness [in the sense of the “Hard Problem” (<a href="#B70">Chalmers, 2013</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_4">However, I return to this issue at the end, discussing <span class="caps">TAME</span>’s view of sentience as fundamentally tied to goal-directed activity, only some aspects of which can be studied <i>via</i> third person approaches.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-9">
	<li class="s" id="para-9_1">The main goal is to help advance and delineate an exciting emerging field at the intersection of biology, philosophy, and the information sciences.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-9_2">By proposing a new framework and examining it in a broad context of now physically realizable (not merely logically possible) living structures, it may be possible to bring conceptual, philosophical thought up to date with recent advances in science and technology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-9_3">At stake are current knowledge gaps in evolutionary, developmental, and cell biology, a new roadmap for regenerative medicine, lessons that could be ported to artificial intelligence and robotics, and broader implications for ethics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cognition">Cognition: Changing the Subject</h2>
<ul class="p" id="para-10">
	<li class="s" id="para-10_1">Even advanced animals are really collective intelligences (<a href="#B85">Couzin, 2007</a>, <a href="#B86">2009</a>; <a href="#B361">Valentini et al., 2018</a>), exploiting still poorly-understood scaling and binding features of metazoan architectures that share a continuum with looser swarms that have been termed “liquid brains” (<a href="#B335">Sole et al., 2019</a>). Studies of “centralized control” focus on a brain, which is in effect a network of cells performing functions that many cell types, including bacteria, can do (<a href="#B182">Koshland, 1983</a>). The embodied nature of cognition means that the minds of Selves are dependent on a highly plastic material substrate which changes not only on evolutionary time scales but also during the lifetime of the agent itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-11">
	<li class="s" id="para-11_1">The central consequence of the composite nature of all intelligences is that the Self is subject to significant change in real-time (<a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>). This means both slow maturation through experience (a kind of “software” change that doesn’t disrupt traditional ways of thinking about agency), as well as radical changes of the material in which a given mind is implemented (<a href="#B198">Levin, 2020</a>). The owner, or subject of memories, preferences, and in more advanced cases, credit and blame, is very malleable.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_2">At the same time, fascinating mechanisms somehow ensure the persistence of Self (such as complex memories) despite drastic alterations of substrate.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_3">For example, the massive remodeling of the caterpillar brain, followed by the morphogenesis of an entirely different brain suitable for the moth or beetle, does not wipe all the memories of the larva but somehow maps them onto behavioral capacities in the post-metamorphosis host, despite its entirely different body (<a href="#B7">Alloway, 1972</a>; <a href="#B354">Tully et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#B328">Sheiman and Tiras, 1996</a>; <a href="#B12">Armstrong et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#B299">Ray, 1999</a>; <a href="#B42">Blackiston et al., 2008</a>). Not only that, but memories can apparently persist following the complete regeneration of brains in some organisms (<a href="#B231">McConnell et al., 1959</a>; <a href="#B83">Corning, 1966</a>; <a href="#B331">Shomrat and Levin, 2013</a>) such as planaria, in which prior knowledge and behavioral tendencies are somehow transferred onto a newly-constructed brain.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_4">Even in vertebrates, such as fish (<a href="#B365">Versteeg et al., 2021</a>) and mammals (<a href="#B371">von der Ohe et al., 2006</a>), brain size and structure can change repeatedly during their lifespan.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_5">This is crucial to understanding agency and intelligence at multiple scales and in unfamiliar embodiments because observations like this begin to break down the notion of Selves as monadic, immutable objects with a privileged scale.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_6">Becoming comfortable with biological cognitive agents that are malleable in terms of form and function (change radically during the lifetime of an individual) makes it easier to understand the origins and changes of cognition during evolution or as the result of bioengineering effort.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="figure" id="figure-3">
	<li class="s" id="figure-3_1"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Cognitive Selves can change in real-time.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-3_2">(A) Caterpillars metamorphose into butterflies, going through a process in which their body, brain, and cognitive systems are drastically remodeled during the lifetime of a single agent.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-3_3">Importantly, memories remain and persist through this process (<a href="#B46">Blackiston et al., 2015</a>). (B) Planaria cut into pieces regenerate, with each piece re-growing and remodeling precisely what is needed to form an entire animal.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-3_4">&lpar;C&rpar; Planarians derived from tail fragments of trained worms still retain original information, illustrating the ability of memories to move across tissues and be reimprinted on newly-developing brains (<a href="#B83">Corning, 1966</a>, <a href="#B84">1967</a>; <a href="#B331">Shomrat and Levin, 2013</a>). Images by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-12">
	<li class="s" id="para-12_1">This little-studied intersection between regeneration/remodeling and cognition highlights the fascinating plasticity of the body, brain, and mind; traditional model systems in which cognition is mapped onto a stable, discrete, mature brain are insufficient to fully understand the relationship between the Self and its material substrate.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-12_2">Many scientists study the behavioral properties of caterpillars, and of butterflies, but the transition zone in-between, from the perspective of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, provides an important opportunity to study the mind-body relationship by changing the body during the lifetime of the agent (not just during evolution). Note that continuity of being across drastic biological remodeling is not only relevant for unusual cases in the animal kingdom, but is a fundamental property of most life—even humans change from a collection of cells to a functional individual, <i>via</i> a gradual morphogenetic process that constructs an active Self in real time.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-12_3">This has not been addressed in biology, and likewise not yet in computer science, where machine learning approaches use static neural networks (there is not a formalism for altering artificial neural networks’ architecture on the fly).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-13">
	<li class="s" id="para-13_1">What are the invariants that enable a Self to persist (and be recognizable by third-person investigations) despite such change? Memory is a good candidate (<a href="#B330">Shoemaker, 1959</a>; <a href="#B8">Ameriks, 1976</a>; <a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>). However, at least certain kinds of memories can be transferred between individuals, by transplants of brain tissue or molecular engrams (<a href="#B279">Pietsch and Schneider, 1969</a>; <a href="#B230">McConnell and Shelby, 1970</a>; <a href="#B39">Bisping et al., 1971</a>; <a href="#B73">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#B30">Bedecarrats et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#B2">Abraham et al., 2019</a>). Importantly, the movement of memories across individual animals is only a special case of the movement of memory in biological tissue in general.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-13_2">Even when housed in the same “body,” memories must move between tissues—for example, in a trained planarian’s tail fragment re-imprinting its learned information onto the newly regenerated brain, or the movement of memories onto new brain tissue during metamorphosis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-13_3">In addition to the spatial movement and re-mapping of memories onto new substrates, there is also a temporal component, as each memory is really an instance of communication between past and future Selves.</li>

To flesh out this approach, I first make explicit some of its philosophical foundations, and then discuss specific conceptual tools that have been developed to begin the task of understanding embodied cognition in the space of mind-as-it-can-be (a sister concept to Langton’s motto for the artificial life community—“life as it can be”) (<a href="#B192">Langton, 1995</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="foundations">Philosophical Foundations of an Approach to Diverse Intelligences</h3>
<ul class="p" id="para-20">
	<li class="s" id="para-20_1">One key pillar of this research program is the commitment to gradualism with respect to almost all important cognition-related properties: advanced minds are in important ways generated in a continuous manner from much more humble proto-cognitive systems.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-20_2">On this view, it is hopeless to look for a clear bright line that demarcates “true” cognition (such as that of humans, great apes, etc.) from metaphorical “as if cognition” or “just physics.” Taking evolutionary biology seriously means that there is a continuous series of forms that connect any cognitive system with much more humble ones.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-20_3">While phylogenetic history already refutes views of a magical arrival of “true cognition” in one generation, from parents that didn’t have it (instead stretching the process of cognitive expansion over long time scales and slow modification), recent advances in biotechnology make this completely implausible.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-20_4">For any putative difference between a creature that is proposed to have <i>true</i> preferences, memories, and plans and one that supposedly has <i>none</i>, we can now construct in-between, hybrid forms which then make it impossible to say whether the resulting being is an Agent or not.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-20_5">Many pseudo-problems evaporate when a binary view of cognition is dissolved by an appreciation of the plasticity and interoperability of living material at all scales of organization.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-20_6">A definitive discussion of the engineering of preferences and goal-directedness, in terms of hierarchy requirements and upper-directedness, is given in <a href="#B239">McShea (2013</a>, <a href="#B240">2016)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-21">
	<li class="s" id="para-21_1">For example, one view is that only biological, evolved forms have intrinsic motivation, while software AI agents are only faking it <i>via</i> functional performance [but don’t actually <i>care</i> (<a href="#B265">Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2007</a>, <a href="#B266">2013</a>; <a href="#B215">Lyon and Kuchling, 2021</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-21_2">But which biological systems <i>really</i> care—fish? Single cells? Do mitochondria (which used to be independent organisms) have true preferences about their own or their host cells’ physiological states?  The lack of consensus on this question in classical (natural) biological systems, and the absence of convincing criteria that can be used to sort all possible agents to one or the other side of a sharp line, highlight the futility of truly binary categories.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-21_3">Moreover, we can now readily construct hybrid systems that consist of any percentage of robotics tightly coupled to on-board living cells and tissues, which function together as one integrated being.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-21_4">How many living cells does a robot need to contain before the living system’s “true” cognition bleeds over into the whole? On the continuum between human brains (with electrodes and a machine learning converter chip) that drive assistive devices (e.g., 95% human, 5% robotics), and robots with on-board cultured human brain cells instrumentized to assist with performance (5% human, 95% robotics), where can one draw the line—given that any desired percent combination is possible to make? No quantitative answer is sufficient to push a system “over the line” because there is no such line (at least, no convincing line has been proposed). Interesting aspects of agency or cognition are rarely if ever Boolean values.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-22_3">Specifically, while major differences in cognitive function of course exist among diverse intelligences, transitions between them have not been shown to be binary or rapid relative to the timescale of individual agents.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-22_4">There is no plausible reason to think that evolution produces parents that don’t have “true cognition” but give rise to offspring that suddenly do, or that development starts with an embryo that has no “true preferences” and sharply transitions into an animal that does, etc.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-22_5">Moreover, bioengineering and chimerization can produce a smooth series of transitional forms between any two forms that are proposed to have, or not have, any cognitive property.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-22_6">Thus, agents gradually shift (during their lifetime, as result of development, metamorphosis, or interactions with other agents, or during evolutionary timescales) between great transitions in cognitive capacity, expressing and experiencing intermediate states of cognitive capacity that must be recognized by empirical approaches to study them.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-27_2">The mainstream view (e.g., Morgan’s Canon) is that it’s too easy to fall into a trap of “anthropomorphizing” systems with only apparent cognitive powers, when one should only be looking for models focused on mechanistic, lower levels of description that eschew any kind of teleology or mental capacity (<a href="#B249">Morgan, 1903</a>; <a href="#B114">Epstein, 1984</a>). However, analysis shows that this view provides no useful parsimony (<a href="#B62">Cartmill, 2017</a>).

	<li class="s" id="para-27_4">Humans (and many other animals) readily attribute agency to systems in their environment; scientists should be comfortable with testing out a theory of mind regarding various complex systems for the exact same reason—it can often greatly enhance prediction and control, by recognizing the true features of the systems with which we interact.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-27_5">This perspective implies that there is no such thing as “anthropomorphizing” because human beings have no unique essential property which can be inappropriately attributed to agents that have <i>none</i> of it.</li>

The scale of their goal-directed activity is estimated (collapsed onto one axis of space and one of time, as in Relativity diagrams). Importantly, this way of visualizing the sophistication of agency is a schematic of goal space—it is not meant to represent the spatial extent of sensing or effector range, but rather the scale of events about which they care and the boundary of states that they can possibly represent or work to change.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-4_8">This defines a kind of cognitive light cone (a boundary to any agent’s area of concern); the largest area represents the “now,” with fading efficacy both backward (accessing past events with decreasing reliability) and forward (limited prediction accuracy for future events).

The scope of states that an agent can possibly be stressed by, in effect, defines their degree of cognitive capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1b_3">Stress is a systemic response to a difference between current state and a desired setpoint; it is an essential component to scaling of Selves because it enables different modules (which sense and act on things at different scales and in distributed locations) to be bound together in one global homeostatic loop (toward a larger purpose). Systemic stress occurs when one sub-agent is not satisfied about its local conditions, and propagates its unhappiness outward as hard-to-ignore signals.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1b_4">In this process, stress pathways serve the same function as hidden layers in a network, enabling the system to be more adaptive by connecting diverse modular inputs and outputs to the same basic stress minimization loop.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1b_5">Such networks scale stress, but stress is also what helps the network scale up its agency—a bidirectional positive feedback loop.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="box" id="box-1c">
	<li class="s" id="box-1c_1">The key is that this stress signal is unpleasant to the other sub-agents, closely mimicking their own stress machinery (genetic conservation: my internal stress molecule is the same as your stress molecule, which contributes to the same “wiping of ownership” that is implemented by gap junctional connections). By propagating unhappiness in this way (in effect, turning up the global system “energy” which facilitates tendency for moving in various spaces), this process recruits distant sub-agents to act, to reduce their own perception of stress.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1c_2">For example, if an organ primordium is in the wrong location and needs to move, the surrounding cells are more willing to get out of the way if by doing so they reduce the amount of stress signal they receive.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1c_3">It may be a process akin to run-and-tumble for bacteria, with stress as the indicator of when to move and when to stop moving, in physiological, transcriptional, or morphogenetic space.</li>
	<li class="s" id="box-1c_4">Another example is compensatory hypertrophy, in which damage in one organ induces other cells to take up its workload, growing or taking on new functions if need be (<a href="#B344">Tamori and Deng, 2014</a>; <a href="#B122">Fontes et al., 2020</a>). In this way, stress causes other agents to work toward the same goal, serving as an influence that binds subunits across space into a coherent higher Self and resists the “struggle of the parts” (<a href="#B158">Heams, 2012</a>). Interestingly, stress spreads not only horizontally in space (across cell fields) but also vertically, in time: effects of stress response is one of the things most easily transferred by transgenerational inheritance (<a href="#B384">Xue and Acar, 2018</a>).</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-40_1">Additional implications of this view are that Selves: are malleable (the borders and scale of any Self can change over time); can be created by design or by evolution; and are multi-scale entities that consist of other, smaller Selves (and conversely, scale up to make larger Selves). Indeed they are a patchwork of agents [akin to Theophile Bordeu’s “many little lives” (<a href="#B154">Haigh, 1976</a>; <a href="#B383">Wolfe, 2008</a>)] that overlap with each other, and compete, communicate, and cooperate both horizontally (at their own level of organization) and vertically [with their component subunits and the super-Selves of which they are a part (<a href="#B332">Sims, 2020</a>)].</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-41_1">Another important invariant for comparing diverse intelligences is that they are all solving problems, in some space (<a href="#F5">Figure 5</a>). It is proposed that the traditional problem-solving behavior we see in standard animals in 3D space is just a variant of evolutionarily more ancient capacity to solve problems in metabolic, physiological, transcriptional, and morphogenetic spaces (as one possible sequential timeline along which evolution pivoted some of the same strategies to solve problems in new spaces). For example, when planaria are exposed to barium, a non-specific potassium channel blocker, their heads explode.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-41_2">Remarkably, they soon regenerate heads that are completely insensitive to barium (<a href="#B113">Emmons-Bell et al., 2019</a>). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that relatively few genes out of the entire genome were regulated to enable the cells to resolve this physiological stressor using transcriptional effectors to change how ions and neurotransmitters are handled by the cells.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-41_3">Barium is not something planaria ever encounter ecologically (so there should not be innate evolved responses to barium exposure), and cells don’t turn over fast enough for a selection process (e.g., with bacterial persisters after antibiotic exposure). The task of determining which genes, out of the entire genome, can be transcriptionally regulated to return to an appropriate physiological regime is an example of an unconventional intelligence navigating a large-dimensional space to solve problems in real-time (<a href="#B372">Voskoboynik et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#B109">Elgart et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B334">Soen et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B324">Schreier et al., 2017</a>).

They solve this entirely novel (not primed by evolutionary experience with barium) stressor by a very efficient traversal in transcriptional space to rapidly up/down regulate a very small number of genes that allows them to conduct their physiology despite the essential K<sup>+</sup> flux blockade.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-42">
	<li class="s" id="para-42_1">The common feature in all such instances is that the agent must navigate its space(s), preferentially occupying adaptive regions despite perturbations from the outside world (and from internal events) that tend to pull it into novel regions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-42_2">Agents (and their sub- and super-agents) construct internal models of their spaces (<a href="#B32">Beer, 2014</a>, <a href="#B33">2015</a>; <a href="#B34">Beer and Williams, 2015</a>; <a href="#B164">Hoffman et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B120">Fields et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B163">Hoffman, 2017</a>; <a href="#B289">Prentner, 2019</a>; <a href="#B100">Dietrich et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B288">Prakash et al., 2020</a>), which may or may not match the view of their action space developed by their conspecifics, parasites, and scientists.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-42_3">Thus, the space one is navigating is in an important sense virtual (belonging to some Agent’s self-model), is developed and often modified “on the fly” (in addition to that hardwired by the structure of the agent), and not only faces outward to infer a useful structure of its option space but also faces inward to map its own body and somatotopic properties (<a href="#B48">Bongard et al., 2006</a>). The lower-level subsystems simplify the search space for the higher-level agent because their modular competency means that the higher-level system doesn’t need to manage all the microstates [a strong kind of hierarchical modularity (<a href="#B388">Zhao et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#B213">Lowell and Pollack, 2016</a>)].</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-43_3">This buffering enables the flip side of homeostatic problem-driven (stress reduction) behavior by cells: the exploration of the space for novel opportunities (creativity) by the collective agent, and the ability to acquire more complex goals [in effect, beginning the climb to Maslow’s hierarchy (<a href="#B346">Taormina and Gao, 2013</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-43_4">Of course it must be pointed out that this way of conceiving intelligence is one of many, and is proposed here as a way to enable the concept to be experimentally ported over to unfamiliar substrates, while capturing what is essential about it in a way that does not depend on arbitrary restrictions that will surely not survive advances in synthetic bioengineering, machine learning, and exobiology.</li>

This view is closely aligned with that of “upper directedness” (<a href="#B238">McShea, 2012</a>), in which the larger system directs its components’ behavior by constraints and rewards for coarse-grained outcomes, not microstates (<a href="#B238">McShea, 2012</a>).</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-50_4">On this view, there is a privileged level of causation—that of biochemistry—and all of the outcomes are to be seen as the emergent consequences of highly parallel execution of local rules (a cellular automaton in every sense of the term). Of course, it should be noted that the forefathers of developmental biology, such as <a href="#B337">Spemann (1967)</a>, were already well-aware of the possible role of cognitive concepts in this arena and others have occasionally pointed out detailed homologies (<a href="#B152">Grossberg, 1978</a>; <a href="#B274">Pezzulo and Levin, 2015</a>). This becomes clearer when we step away from the typical examples seen in developmental biology textbooks and look at some phenomena that, despite the recent progress in molecular genetics, remain important knowledge gaps (<a href="#F6">Figure 6</a>).</li>

<ul class="figure" id="figure-6">
	<li class="s" id="figure-6_1"><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Morphogenesis as an example of collective intelligence and plasticity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-6_2">The results of complex morphogenesis are the behavior in morphospace of a collective intelligence of cells.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-6_3">It is essential to understand this collective intelligence because by themselves, progress in molecular genetics is insufficient.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-6_4">For example, despite genomic information and much pathway data on the behavior of stem cells in planarian regeneration, there are no models predicting what happens when cells from a flat-headed species are injected into a round-headed species (A): what kind of head will they make, and will regeneration/remodeling ever stop, since the target morphology can never match what either set of cells expects? Development has the ability to overcome unpredictable perturbations to reach its goals in morphospace: tadpoles made with scrambled positions of craniofacial organs can make normal frogs (B) because the tissues will move from their abnormal starting positions in novel ways until a correct frog face is achieved (<a href="#B363">Vandenberg et al., 2012</a>). This illustrates that the genetics seeds the development of hardware executing not an invariant set of movements but rather an error minimization (homeostatic) loop with reference to a stored anatomical setpoint (target morphology). The paths through morphospace are not unique, illustrated by the fact that when frog legs are induced to regenerate &lpar;C&rpar;, the intermediate stages are not like the developmental path of limb development (forming a paddle and using programmed cell death to separate the digits) but rather like a plant (C′), in which a central core gives rise to digits growing as offshoots (green arrowheads) which nevertheless ends up being a very normal-looking frog leg (<a href="#B352">Tseng and Levin, 2013</a>). (D) The plasticity extends across levels: when newt cells are made very large by induced polyploidy, they not only adjust the number of cells that work together to build kidney tubules with correct lumen diameter, but can call up a completely different molecular mechanism (cytoskeletal bending instead of cell:cell communication) to make a tubule consisting in cross-section of just 1 cell wrapped around itself; this illustrates intelligence of the collective, as it creatively deploys diverse lower-level modules to solve novel problems.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-6_5">The plasticity is not only structural but functional: when tadpoles are created to (E) have eyes on their tails (instead of in their heads), the animals can see very well (<a href="#B41">Blackiston and Levin, 2013</a>), as revealed by their performance in visual learning paradigms (F). Such eyes are also competent modules: they first form correctly despite their aberrant neighbors (muscle, instead of brain), then put out optic nerves which they connect to the nearby spinal cord, and later they ignore the programmed cell death of the tail, riding it backward to end up on the posterior of the frog (G). All of this reveals the remarkable multi-scale competency of the system which can adapt to novel configurations on the fly, not requiring evolutionary timescales for adaptive functionality (and providing important buffering for mutations that make changes whose disruptive consequences are hidden from selection by the ability of modules to get their job done despite changes in their environment).

<ul class="p" id="para-51">
	<li class="s" id="para-51_1">Morphogenesis (broadly defined) is not only a process that produces the same robust outcome from the same starting condition (development from a fertilized egg). In animals such as salamanders, cells will also <i>re</i>-build complex structures such as limbs, no matter where along the limb axis they are amputated, and <i>stop when it is complete</i>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-51_2">While this regenerative capacity is not limitless, the basic observation is that the cells cooperate toward a specific, invariant endstate (the target morphology), from diverse starting conditions, and cease their activity when the correct pattern has been achieved.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-51_3">Thus, the cells do not merely perform a rote set of steps toward an emergent outcome, but modify their activity in a context-dependent manner to achieve a specific anatomical target morphology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-51_4">In this, morphogenetic systems meet James’ test for minimal mentality: “fixed ends with varying means” (<a href="#B173">James, 1890</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-52">
	<li class="s" id="para-52_1">For example, tadpoles turn into frogs by rearranging their craniofacial structures: the eyes, nostrils, and jaws move as needed to turn a tadpole face into a frog face (<a href="#F6">Figure 6B</a>). Guided by the hypothesis that this was not a hardwired but an intelligent process that could reach its goal despite novel challenges, we made tadpoles in which these organs were in the wrong positions—so-called Picasso Tadpoles (<a href="#B363">Vandenberg et al., 2012</a>). Amazingly, they tend to turn into largely normal frogs because the craniofacial organs move in novel, abnormal paths [sometimes overshooting and needing to return a bit (<a href="#B280">Pinet et al., 2019</a>)] and stop <i>when they get to the correct frog face positions</i>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-52_2">Similarly, frog legs that are artificially induced to regenerate create a correct final form but not <i>via</i> the normal developmental steps (<a href="#B352">Tseng and Levin, 2013</a>). Students who encounter such phenomena and have not yet been inoculated with the belief that molecular biology is a privileged level of explanation (<a href="#B259">Noble, 2012</a>) ask the obvious (and proper) question: how does it know what a correct face or leg shape is?</li>

This process requires cells at the growth plate in the scalp to sense, and remember for months, the location of a transient damage event within a stereotypical branched structure, and reproduce it in subsequent years by over-riding the wild-type stereotypical growth patterns of cells, instead guiding them to a novel outcome.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-54_2">This is an example of experience-dependent, re-writable pattern memory, in which the target morphology (the setpoint for anatomical homeostasis) is re-written within standard hardware.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-55">
	<li class="s" id="para-55_1">Planarian flatworms can be cut into multiple pieces, and each fragment regenerates precisely what is missing at each location (and re-scales the remaining tissue as needed) to make a perfect little worm (<a href="#B63">Cebrià et al., 2018</a>). Some species of planaria have an incredibly messy genome—they are mixoploid due to their method of reproduction: fission and regeneration, which propagates any mutations that don’t kill the stem cell and expands it throughout the lineage [reviewed in <a href="#B119">Fields et al. (2020)</a>].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-55_2">Despite the divergence of genomic information, the worms are champion regenerators, with near 100% fidelity of anatomical structure.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-55_3">Recent data have identified one set of mechanisms mediating the ability of the cells to make, for example, the correct number of heads: a standing bioelectrical distribution across the tissue, generated by ion channels and propagated by electrical synapses known as gap junctions (<a href="#F7">Figures 7A–D</a>). Manipulation of the normal voltage pattern by targeting the gap junctions (<a href="#B336">Sordillo and Bargmann, 2021</a>) or ion channels can give rise to planaria with one, two, or 0 heads, or heads with shape (and brain shape) resembling other extant species of planaria (<a href="#B112">Emmons-Bell et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B342">Sullivan et al., 2016</a>). Remarkably, the worms with abnormal head number are <i>permanently</i> altered to this pattern, despite their wild-type genetics: cut into pieces with no further manipulations, the pieces continue to regenerate with abnormal head number (<a href="#B267">Oviedo et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#B107">Durant et al., 2017</a>). Thus, much like the optogenetic techniques used to incept false behavioral memories into brains (<a href="#B366">Vetere et al., 2019</a>), modulation of transient bioelectric state is a conserved mechanism by which false pattern memories can be re-written into the genetically-specified electrical circuits of a living animal.</li>

<ul class="figure" id="figure-7">
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_1"><strong>Figure 7.</strong> Bioelectrical pattern memories.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_2">Planarian fragments reliably regenerate whatever is missing, and stop when a correct worm is complete.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_3">Normal planaria (A) have 1 head and 1 tail (A-1), expression of anterior genes in the head (A-2), and a standing pattern of resting potential that depolarized on the end that should make a head [(A-3), revealed by voltage-reporting fluorescent dye, depolarized region marked with orange arrowhead].</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_4">When a middle portion is amputated, it regenerates to a correct 1-headed worm (A-4). It is possible to edit the information structure which encodes the target morphology (shape to which the fragments will regenerate). In worms that are anatomically normal (A′-1), with normal gene expression (A′-2), their bioelectric pattern can be altered in place [(A′-3), orange arrowheads mark the two depolarized ends] using ion channel-targeting drugs or RNAi.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_5">The result, after injury, will be a fully viable 2-headed worm (A′-4). Importantly, the pattern shown in panel (A′-3) is not a voltage map of the final 2-headed worm: it’s a map of a 1-headed animal before cutting, which already has the induced false memory indicating that a correct worm should have 2 heads.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_6">In other words, the bioelectrics can diverge from the current state—it is not simply a readout of what the anatomy is doing now, but an orthogonal information medium that is used to guide future changes of anatomy.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_7">This information is latent, only guiding the cellular collective’s anatomical homeostasis activity after injury.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_8">Thus it is also a basal example of counterfactual representation, referring to what should happen <i>if</i> an injury occurs, not what is happening now.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_9">Such changes to the bioelectric target morphology are true memories because they are re-writable but also long-term stable: if cut again, in water with no more channel-perturbing reagents, multiple rounds of regeneration of a genetically wild-type worm continue to give rise to 2-headed forms (B), which can be re-set back to normal by a different bioelectric perturbation (<a href="#B267">Oviedo et al., 2010</a>). The control of morphology by bioelectric patterns is mediated as in the brain &lpar;C&rpar; by cells which have ion channels that set resting potential across the membrane (V<sub>mem</sub>) and propagate those states in computational networks to their neighbors, <i>via</i> electrical synapses known as gap junctions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-7_10">All cells, not just neurons (D) do this, and bioelectric signaling is an ancient information processing modality that pre-dates neurons and brains (<a href="#B119">Fields et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B199">Levin, 2021a</a>). The ability of voltage states to functionally specify modular anatomy is seen when an ion channel is used to set membrane voltage in endodermal cells fated to be gut, to an eye-like bioelectric prepattern (E), which then create an eye on the gut (red arrowhead) (<a href="#B269">Pai et al., 2012</a>). This phenomenon has 2 levels of instruction (F): in addition to our use of voltage to instruct shape at the organ level (not micromanaging individual eye components), the ion channel mRNA-injected cells (cyan β-galactose marker) further instruct their neighbors (brown cells) to participate in forming this ectopic lens.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-56">
	<li class="s" id="para-56_1">A key feature of morphogenesis is that diverse underlying molecular mechanisms can be deployed to reach the same large-scale goal.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-56_2">This plasticity and coarse-graining over subunits’ states is a hallmark of collective cognition, and is also well known in neuroscience (<a href="#B291">Prinz et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#B264">Otopalik et al., 2017</a>). Newt kidney tubules normally have a lumen of a specific size and are made up (in cross section) of 8–10 cells (<a href="#B115">Fankhauser, 1945a</a>,<a href="#B116">b</a>). When the cell size is experimentally enlarged, the same tubules are made of a smaller number of the bigger cells.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-56_3">Even more remarkable than the scaling of the cell number to unexpected size changes (on an ontogenetic, not evolutionary, timescale) is the fact that if the cells are made really huge, <i>just one cell</i> wraps around itself and still makes a proper lumen (<a href="#F6">Figure 6D</a>). Instead of the typical cell-cell interactions that coordinate tubule formation, cytoskeletal deformations within one cell can be deployed to achieve the same end result.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-57">
	<li class="s" id="para-57_1">The plasticity of morphogenesis is significantly isomorphic to that of brains and behavior because the communication dynamics that scale individual neural cells into a coherent Self are ones that evolution honed long before brains appeared, in the context of morphogenic control (<a href="#B119">Fields et al., 2020</a>), and before that, in metabolic control in bacterial biofilms (<a href="#B290">Prindle et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B210">Liu et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B223">Martinez-Corral et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#B385">Yang et al., 2020</a>). Each genome specifies cellular hardware that implements signaling circuits with a robust, reliable default “inborn” morphology—just as genomes give rise to brain circuits that drive instinctual behavior in species that can build nests and do other complex things with no training.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-57_2">However, evolution selected for hardware that can be reprogrammed by experiences, in addition to its robust default functional modes—in body structure, as well as in brain-driven behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-57_3">Many of the brain’s special features are to be found, unsurprisingly, in other forms outside the central nervous system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-57_4">For example, mirror neurons and somatotopic representation are seen in limbs’ response to injury, where the type and site of damage to one limb can be read out within 30 s from imaging the opposite, un-injured limbs (<a href="#B58">Busse et al., 2018</a>). <a href="#T2">Table 2</a> shows the many parallels between morphogenetic and cognitive systems.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-60_2">The collective intelligence of tissues could be sophisticated enough to be trainable <i>via</i> reinforcement learning for specific morphological outcomes.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-60_3">Learning has been suggested by clinical data in the heart (<a href="#B389">Zoghi, 2004</a>), bone (<a href="#B355">Turner et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#B338">Spencer and Genever, 2003</a>), and pancreas (<a href="#B148">Goel and Mehta, 2013</a>). It is predicted that using rewards and punishments (with nutrients/endorphins and shock), not micromanagement of pathway hardware, could be a path to anatomical control in clinical settings, whether for morphology or for gene expression (<a href="#B40">Biswas et al., 2021</a>). This would have massive implications for regenerative medicine, because the complexity barrier prevents advances such as genomic editing from impacting e.g., limb regeneration in the foreseeable future.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-60_4">The same reasons for which we would train a rat for a specific behavior, rather than control all of the relevant neurons to force it to do it like a puppet, explain why the direct control of molecular hardware is a far more difficult biomedical path than understanding the sets of stimuli that could motivate tissues to build a specific desired structure.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-61_1">The key lesson of computer science has been that even with hardware we understand (if we built it ourselves), it is much more efficient and powerful to understand the software and evince desired outcomes by the appropriate stimulation and signaling, not physical rewiring.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-61_2">If the hardware is reprogrammable (and it is here argued that much of the biological hardware meets this transition), one can offload much of the complexity onto the system itself, taking advantage of whatever competence the sub-modules have.</li>

<h3 id="non-neural-biolectricity">Non-neural Bioelectricity: What Bodies Think About</h3>
<ul class="p" id="para-62">
	<li class="s" id="para-62_1">The hardware of the brain consists of ion channels which set the cells’ electrical state, and controllable synapses (e.g., gap junctions) which can propagate those states across the network.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-62_2">This machinery, including the neurotransmitters that eventually transduce these computations into transcriptional and other cell behaviors, is in fact highly conserved and present in all cells, from the time of fertilization (<a href="#F7">Figures 7C,D</a>). A major difference between neural and non-neural bioelectricity is the time constant with which it acts [brains speed up the system into millisecond scales, while developmental voltage changes occur in minutes or hours (<a href="#B157">Harris, 2021</a>; <a href="#B199">Levin, 2021a</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-62_3">Key aspects of this system in any tissue that enable it to support flexible software include the fact that both ion channels and gap junctions are themselves voltage sensitive—in effect, they are transistors (voltage-gated current conductances). This enables evolution to exploit the laws of physics to rapidly generate very complex circuits with positive (memory) and negative (robustness) feedback (<a href="#B194">Law and Levin, 2015</a>; <a href="#B68">Cervera et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#B67">2019a</a>,<a href="#B66">2019b</a>,<a href="#B64">2020a</a>). The fact that a transient voltage state passing through a cell can set off a cycle of progressive depolarization (like an action potential) or gap junctional (GJ) closure means that such circuits readily form dynamical systems memories which can store different information and change their computational behavior without changing the hardware (i.e., not requiring new channels or gap junctions) (<a href="#B277">Pietak and Levin, 2017</a>); this is obvious in the action potential propagations in neural networks but is rarely thought about in development.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-62_4">It should be noted that there are many additional biophysical modalities, such as parahormones, volume conduction, biomechanics (strain and other forces), cytoskeletal dynamics, and perhaps even quantum coherence events that could likewise play interesting roles.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-62_5">These are not discussed here only due to length limitations; instead, we are focusing on the bioelectric mechanisms as one particularly illustrative example of how evolution exploits physics for computation and cognition.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-63">
	<li class="s" id="para-63_1">Consistent with its proposed role, slowly-changing resting potentials serve as instructive patterns guiding embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression (<a href="#B26">Bates, 2015</a>; <a href="#B207">Levin et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B234">McLaughlin and Levin, 2018</a>). In addition to the pattern memories encoded electrically in planaria (discussed above), bioelectric prepatterns have also been shown to dictate the morphogenesis of the face, limbs, and brain, and function in determining primary body axes, size, and organ identity [reviewed in <a href="#B203">Levin and Martyniuk (2018)</a>].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-63_2">One of the most interesting aspects of developmental bioelectricity is its modular nature: very simple voltage states trigger complex, downstream patterning cascades.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-63_3">As in the brain, modularity goes hand-in-hand with pattern completion: the ability of such networks to provide entire behaviors from partial inputs.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-63_4">For example, <a href="#F7">Figure 7F</a> shows how a few cells transduced with an ion channel that sets them into a “make the eye here” trigger recruit their neighbors, in any region of the body, to fulfill the purpose of the subroutine call and create an eye.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-63_5">Such modularity makes it very easy for evolution to develop novel patterns by re-using powerful triggers.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-63_6">Moreover, as do brains, tissues use bioelectric circuits to implement pattern memories that set the target morphology for anatomical homeostasis (as seen in the planarian examples above). This reveals the non-neural material substrate that stores the information in cellular collectives, which is a distributed, dynamic, re-writable form of storage that parallels recent discoveries of how group knowledge is stored in larger-scale agents such as animal swarms (<a href="#B347">Thierry et al., 1995</a>; <a href="#B87">Couzin et al., 2002</a>). Finally, bioelectric domains (<a href="#B272">Pai et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#B271">2018</a>; <a href="#B282">Pitcairn et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B236">McNamara et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#B235">2020</a>) set the borders for groups of cells that are going to complete a specific morphogenetic outcome—a system-level process like “make an eye.” They define the spatio-temporal borders of the modular activity, and suggest a powerful model for how Selves scale in general.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-64">
	<li class="s" id="para-64_1">Gap junctional connections between cells provide an interesting case study for how the borders of the Self can expand or contract, in the case of a morphogenetic collective intelligence (<a href="#F8">Figure 8</a>). Crucially, gap junctions [and gap junctions extended by tunneling nanotubes (<a href="#B374">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#B11">Ariazi et al., 2017</a>)] enable a kind of cellular parabiosis—a regulated fusion between cells that enables lateral inheritance of physiological information, which speeds up processing in the same way that lateral gene inheritance potentiates change on evolutionary timescales.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-64_2">The following is a case study hypothesizing one way in which evolution solves the many-into-one problem (how competent smaller Selves bind into an emergent higher Self), and how this process can break down leading to a reversal (shrinking) of the Self boundary (summarized in <a href="#T3">Table 3</a>).</li>

</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-65">
	<li class="s" id="para-65_1">Single cells (e.g., the protozoan <i>Lacrymaria olor</i>) are very competent in handling morphological, physiological, and behavioral goals on the scale of one cell.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_2">When connected to each other <i>via</i> gap junctions, as in metazoan embryos, several things happen (much of which is familiar to neuroscientists and workers in machine learning in terms of the benefits of neural networks) that lead to the creation of a Self with a new, larger cognitive boundary.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_3">First, when cells join into an electrochemical network, they can now sense events, and act, on a much larger physical “radius of concern” than a single cell.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_4">Moreover, the network can now integrate information coming from spatially disparate regions in complex ways that result in activity in other spatial regions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_5">Second, the network has much more computational power than any of its individual cells (nodes), providing an IQ boost for the newly formed Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_6">In such networks, Hebbian dynamics on the electrical synapse (GJ) can provide association between action in one location and reward in another, which enables the system to support credit assignment at the level of the larger individual.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-66">
	<li class="s" id="para-66_1">The third consequence of GJ connectivity is the partial dissolution of informational boundaries between the subunits.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_2">GJ-mediated signals are unique because they give each cell immediate access to the internal milieu of other cells.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_3">A conventional secreted biochemical signal arrives from the outside, and when it triggers cell receptors on the surface, the cell clearly knows that this information originated externally (and can be attended to, ignored, etc.)—it is easy to maintain boundary between Self and world.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_4">However, imagine a signal like a calcium spike originating in a cell due to some damage stimulus for example.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_5">When that calcium propagates onto the GJ-coupled neighbor, there are no metadata on that signal marking its origin; the recipient cell only knows that a calcium transient occurred, and cannot tell that this information does not belong to it.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_6">The downstream effects of this second messenger event are a kind of false memory for the recipient cell, but a true memory for the collective network of the stimulus that occurred in one part of the individual.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_7">This wiping of ownership information for GJ signals as they propagate through the network is critical to enabling a partial “mind meld” between the cells: keeping identity (in terms of distinct individual history of physiological states—memory) becomes very difficult, as small informational molecules propagate and mix within the network.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_8">Thus, this property of GJ coupling promotes the creation of a larger Self by partially erasing the mnemic boundaries between the parts which might impair their ability to work toward a common goal.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_9">This is a key part of the scaling of the Self by enlarging toward common goals—not by micromanagement, but by bringing multiple subunits into the same goal-directed loop by tightly coupling the sensing, memory, and action steps in a syncytium where all activity is bound toward a system-level teleonomic process.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_10">When individual identities are blurred in favor of longer time-scale, larger computations in tissues, small-horizon (myopic) action in individual cells (e.g., cancer cells’ temporary gains followed by maladaptive death of the host) leads to a more adaptive longer-term future as a healthy organism.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_11">In effect, this builds up long-term collective rationality from the action of short-sighted irrational agents (<a href="#B321">Sasaki and Biro, 2017</a>; <a href="#B37">Berdahl et al., 2018</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-67">
	<li class="s" id="para-67_1">It is important to note that part of this story has already been empirically tested in assays that reveal the shrinking as well as the expansion of the Self boundary (<a href="#F9">Figure 9</a>). One implication of these hypotheses is that the binding process can break down.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-67_2">Indeed this occurs in cancer, where oncogene expression and carcinogen exposure leads to a closure of GJs (<a href="#B367">Vine and Bertram, 2002</a>; <a href="#B195">Leithe et al., 2006</a>). The consequence of this is transformation to cancer, where cells revert to their ancient unicellular selves (<a href="#B200">Levin, 2021b</a>)—shrinking their computational boundaries and treating the rest of the body as external environment.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-67_3">The cells migrate at will and proliferate as much as they can, fulfilling their cell-level goals—metastasis [but also sometimes attempting to, poorly, reboot their multicellularity and make tumors (<a href="#B108">Egeblad et al., 2010</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-67_4">The model implies that this phenotype can be reverted by artificially managing the bioelectric connections between a cell and its neighbors.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-67_5">Indeed, recent data show that managing this connectivity can override default genetically-determined states, inducing metastatic melanoma in a perfectly wild-type background (<a href="#B44">Blackiston et al., 2011</a>) or suppressing tumorigenesis induced by strong oncogenes like p53 or <span class="caps">KRAS</span> mutations (<a href="#B75">Chernet and Levin, 2013a</a>,<a href="#B76">b</a>). The focus on physiological connectivity (information dynamics)—the software—is consistent with the observed facts that genetic alterations (hardware) are not necessary to either induce or revert cancer [reviewed in <a href="#B75">Chernet and Levin (2013a)</a>].</li>

In contrast, cells coupled by gap junctions enable signals to pass directly from one cell’s internal milieu into another.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-9_3">This forms a partial syncytium which helps erase informational boundaries between cells, as memory molecules (results of pathway dynamics) propagate across such cell groups without metadata on which cell originated them.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-9_4">The versatile gating of GJ synapses allows the formation of multicellular Selves that own memories of physiological past events at the tissue level (not just individual cells’) and support larger target patterns, enabling them to cooperate to make complex organs (B). This process can break down: when oncogenes are expressed in tadpoles, voltage dye imaging &lpar;C&rpar; reveals the abnormal voltage state of cells that are disconnected bioelectrically from their neighbors, reverting to an ancient unicellular state (metastasis) that treats the rest of the body as external environment and grows out of control as tumors (D). This process can be prevented (<a href="#B75">Chernet and Levin, 2013a</a>,<a href="#B76">b</a>; <a href="#B74">Chernet et al., 2016</a>) by artificially regulating their bioelectric state [e.g., co-injecting a hyperpolarizing channel with the oncogene, (E)].</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-68_1">All these dynamics lead to a few interesting consequences.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_2">GJ-mediated communications are not merely conversations (in the way that external signaling is)—they are binding, in the sense that once a GJ is open, a cell is subject to whatever comes in from the neighbor.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_3">In the same sense, having a synapse makes one vulnerable to the state of neighbors.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_4">GJs spread (dilute) the pain of depolarization, but at the same time give a cell’s neighbors the power to change its state.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_5">Compatible with the proposal that the magnitude of a Self is the scale and complexity of states by which it can be stressed, connections by tunable, dynamic GJs greatly expand the spatial, temporal, and complexity of things that can irritate cells; complex events from far away can now percolate into a cell <i>via</i> non-linear GJ paths through the network, and enabling the drive to minimize such events now necessarily involves homeostatic activity of goal states, sensing, and activity on a much larger scale.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_6">Stress signals, propagating through such networks, incentivize other regions of the tissue to act cooperatively in response to <i>distant</i> events by harnessing their selfish drive to reduce their own stress.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_7">This facilitates the coherent, system-level response to perturbations beyond their local consequences, and gives rise to larger Selves able to react coherently to stressful departures from more complex, spatially-distributed allostatic setpoints.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_8">For example, whereas a solitary cell might be stressed (and react to) abnormal local pH, cells that are part of a transplanted salamander limb will be induced to a more grandiose activity: they will change the number of fingers they produce to be correct relative to the limb’s new position in the host’s body (<a href="#B316">Ruud, 1929</a>), a decision that involves large-scale sensing, decision-making, and control.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-69">
	<li class="s" id="para-69_1">A fourth consequence of the coupling is that cooperation in general is greatly enhanced.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-69_2">In the game theory sense, it is impossible to cheat against your neighbor if you are physiologically coupled.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-69_3">Any positive or negative effects of a cell’s actions toward the neighboring cell are immediately propagated back to it, in effect producing one individual in which the parts cannot “defect” against each other.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-69_4">This dynamic suggests an interesting twist on Prisoners’ Dilemma models in which the number of agents is not fixed, because they have the options of Cooperate, Defect, Merge, and Split (we are currently analyzing such models). Specifically, merging with another agent creates an important dimensionality reduction (because defection is no longer an option); this not only changes the calculus of game theory as applied to biological interactions, but also the action space itself.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-69_5">These dynamics take place on a developmental timescale, complementing the rich existing literature on game theory in evolution (<a href="#B228">Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995</a>; <a href="#B227">Maynard Smith, 1999</a>; <a href="#B232">McEvoy, 2009</a>; <a href="#B268">Pacheco et al., 2014</a>).</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-70_1">Indeed, the smaller and larger agents’ traversal of their various spaces provides a way to think about how smaller agents’ (cell-level) simple homeostatic loops can scale up into large, organ-level anatomical homeostatic loops.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-70_2">Prentner recently showed how agents build up spatial models of their worlds by taking actions that nullify changes in their experience (<a href="#B289">Prentner, 2019</a>). Working to nullify changes to one’s state that would otherwise be induced by the vagaries of external environment (and other agents) is the core of homeostasis—the action loops that seek to preserve important states against intervention and entropy.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-70_3">This is not only for physical movement (which results in a creature perceiving itself to be situated in spacetime) but also for other states in which actuation takes place <i>via</i> turning on/off specific genes, remodeling an anatomy, or opening/closing ion channels to change physiological state.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-70_4">An agent can notice patterns in what actions it had to take to keep in homeostasis despite various perturbations that occur, and based on that refine an internal model of some space within which it is acting.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-70_6">Bioelectricity provides examples where cell-level physiological homeostats form networks that implement much larger-scale pattern memories as attractors, akin to Hopfield networks (<a href="#F10">Figure 10</a>; <a href="#B166">Hopfield, 1982</a>; <a href="#B172">Inoue, 2008</a>; <a href="#B277">Pietak and Levin, 2017</a>; <a href="#B68">Cervera et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#B67">2019a</a>,<a href="#B66">b</a>,<a href="#B64">2020a</a>).

	<li class="s" id="figure-10_2">Gap junctions are a type of connection architecture that facilitates scaling of goal states (and thus expands the cognitive cone of cellular agents). A single cell’s homeostatic cycle has 3 parts: measurements, comparison to a stored setpoint, and acting <i>via</i> effectors to stay in or reach the correct region of state space (A). When coupled into gap junctions (B), each of these 3 components expands in size and complexity: the cell group is able to (1) measure a larger region (reacting to spatially more complex inputs, not just local conditions), (2) store a more complex setpoint pattern, and (3) act (deform, grow, etc.) at a scale that produces large-scale anatomical change.</li>

Recent advances reveal that bioelectric states can form very powerful master inducers that initiate self-limiting organogenesis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-79_2">For example, the action of a single ion channel can induce an eye-specific bioelectric state that creates complete eyes in gut endoderm, spinal cord, and posterior tissues (<a href="#B269">Pai et al., 2012</a>)—locations where genetic “master regulators” like the <i>Pax6</i> transcription factor are insufficient in vertebrates (<a href="#B79">Chow et al., 1999</a>). Likewise, misexpression of a proton pump (or a 1-h ionophore soak) to trigger bioelectric changes in an amputation wound can induce an entire 8-day cascade of building a complete tadpole tail (<a href="#B4">Adams et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#B351">Tseng et al., 2010</a>).

The investigation of somatic bioelectric states as primitive “pattern memories” and the expansion of computational science beyond neurons will enrich the understanding of cell biology at multiple scales beyond molecular mechanisms, as is currently only done with respect to the brain (<a href="#B222">Marr, 1982</a>).

When an eye primordium appears in the wrong place (e.g., a tadpole tail), it still forms a correctly patterned, functional organ, manages to get its data to the brain (<i>via</i> spinal cord connection) to enable vision (<a href="#F6">Figure 6E</a>), and (if somewhere in the head) moves to the correct place during metamorphosis (<a href="#B363">Vandenberg et al., 2012</a>). When cells are artificially made to be very large and have several times the normal genetic material, morphogenesis adapts to this and still builds an overall correct animal (<a href="#B115">Fankhauser, 1945a</a>,<a href="#B116">b</a>).

	<li class="s" id="para-85_4">This is certainly true at the scale of tissues during the lifetime of an individual [as in the inverse relationship between regeneration and cancerous defection from large-scale target morphology (<a href="#B200">Levin, 2021b</a>)], but may be true on evolutionary time scales as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-86">
	<li class="s" id="para-86_1">Second, <span class="caps">MCA</span> reduces apparent pleiotropy—the fact that most mutations have multiple effects (<a href="#B52">Boyle et al., 2017</a>). For example, a change in an important canonical signaling pathway such as Wnt or <span class="caps">BMP</span> (<a href="#B297">Raible and Ragland, 2005</a>) is going to have numerous consequences for an organism.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-86_2">Suppose a mutation appears that moves the mouth off of its optimal position (bad for fitness) but also has some positive (adaptive) feature elsewhere in the body.</li>

In effect, evolution doesn’t have to solve the very difficult search problem of “how to improve feature X without touching features Y. Z which already work well,” and reaps massive efficiency (time) savings by not having to wait until the search process stumbles onto a way to directly encode an improvement that is either isolated from other features, or improves them all simultaneously (<a href="#B373">Wagner et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#B242">Melo et al., 2016</a>).</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-87_2">A lineage has the chance to find out what pro-adaptive things a mutation can do, because competency hides the negative consequences.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-87_3">This gives time for new mutations to appear that hardwire the compensatory changes that had to be applied—an analogy to the proposed Baldwin effect (<a href="#B165">Hogenson, 2001</a>; <a href="#B105">Downing, 2004</a>; <a href="#B307">Robinson and Barron, 2017</a>).

	<li class="s" id="para-87_4">Indeed, multiscale competency is beneficial not only for natural evolution, but also for soft robotics and synthetic bioengineering because it helps cross the sim-to-real gap: models do not have to be 100% realistic to be predictively useful if the component modules can adaptively make up for some degree of deficiency in the controller design (<a href="#B53">Brooks, 1986</a>).</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-89_2">What enables the associative memory in this collective intelligence are the delay lines (nervous system) between the paws and the intestinal lining which provide a kind of patience—a tolerance of the temporal delay between the action and the reward and the ability to link extremely diverse modules on both ends (different kinds of actions can be linked to arbitrary rewards). <span class="caps">MCA</span> does the same thing for evolutionary learning (<a href="#B379">Watson et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#B378">2016</a>; <a href="#B287">Power et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#B376">Watson and Szathmary, 2016</a>; <a href="#B183">Kouvaris et al., 2017</a>), making it easier for systems to reap selection rewards for arbitrary moves in genotype space.</li>

The plasticity and goal-directedness of modules (as opposed to hardwired patterns) serve to reduce the sim-to-real gap (<a href="#B187">Kriegman et al., 2020b</a>): because the current environment always offers novel challenges compared to prior experiences which evolution (or human design) uses to prepare responses, the <span class="caps">MCA</span> architecture doesn’t take history too seriously, relying on plasticity and problem-solving more than on fine-tuning micromodels of what to do in specific cases.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-90_6">On this view, cancer cells are not more selfish than tissues—they are all equally selfish, but maintain goals appropriate to smaller scales of Selves.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-90_7">Indeed, even the parts of one normal body don’t perfectly cooperate—this is as true in development (<a href="#B139">Gawne et al., 2020</a>) as it is in cognitive science (<a href="#B104">Dorahy et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#B304">Reinders et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#B305">2019</a>). A picture is emerging of how evolution exploits the local competency of modules, competing and cooperating, to scale these subsystems’ sensing, actuation, and setpoint memories to give rise to coherent larger-scale Selves.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-90_8">Overall, the <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework addresses functional aspects only, and is compatible with several views on phenomenal consciousness in compound Selves (<a href="#B69">Chalmers, 1996</a>). However, it does have a few implications for the study of Consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-91">
	<li class="s" id="para-91_1">While the <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework focuses on 3rd-person observable properties, it does make some commitments to ways of thinking about consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_2">Provisionally, I suggest that consciousness also comes in degrees and kinds (is not binary) for the same reasons argued for continuity of cognition: if consciousness is fundamentally embodied, the plasticity and gradual malleability of bodies suggests that it is a strong requirement for proponents of phase transitions to specify what kind of “atomic” (not further divisible) bodily change makes for a qualitative shift in capacity consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_3">Another implication of <span class="caps">TAME</span> is that while “embodiment” is critical for consciousness, it is not restricted to physical bodies acting in 3D space, but also includes perception-action systems working in all sorts of spaces.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_4">This implies, counter to many people’s intuitions, that systems that operate in morphogenetic, transcriptional, and other spaces should also have some (if very minimal) degree of consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_5">This in turn suggests that an agent, such as a typical modern human, is really a patchwork of many diverse consciousnesses, only one of which is usually capable of verbally reporting its states (and, not surprisingly, given its limited access and self-boundary, believes itself to be a unitary, sole owner of the body).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h2>
<ul class="p" id="para-92">
	<li class="s" id="para-92_1">What is necessary for consciousness? <span class="caps">TAME</span>’s perspective is fundamentally that of the primacy of goal-directed activity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-92_2">Thus, consciousness accompanies specific types of cognitive processes which exert energy toward goals, but as described above, those processes can take forms very divergent from our typical brain-centered view.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-92_3">Unlike other panpsychist views, <span class="caps">TAME</span> does not claim that mind is inevitably baked in regardless of physical implementation or structure.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-92_4">Causal structure and cybernetic properties of the embodiment are key determinants of consciousness capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-92_5">However, as the minimal degree of internal self-determination and goal-directedness is apparently present even in particles (<a href="#B117">Feynman, 1942</a>; <a href="#B141">Georgiev and Georgiev, 2002</a>; <a href="#B262">Ogborn et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#B176">Kaila and Annila, 2008</a>; <a href="#B298">Ramstead et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#B189">Kuchling et al., 2020a</a>), there may be no true “0” on the scale of consciousness in the universe.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-92_6">While simple accretion does not magnify the nano-goal-directed activity and indeterminate action of particles (e.g., rocks are not more conscious, and probably less, than particles in specific contexts), biological organization does amplify it, resulting in scaling up of sentience.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-93">
	<li class="s" id="para-93_1">Of course, these implications will be unpalatable conclusions for many.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-93_2">It should be kept in mind that <span class="caps">TAME</span> is compatible with several different views on consciousness, and does not need to commit to one specific philosophy.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-93_3">It is fundamentally a framework for enabling empirical experiments, and its practical utility remains, regardless of the above speculations.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-93_4">Moreover, I remain skeptical about being able to say anything definitive about consciousness <i>per se</i> (as distinct from correlates of consciousness) from a 3rd-person, objective perspective.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-93_5">Thus, however unappealing the above view may be, I see no way of rigorously showing why any other claim about consciousness and what it requires is demonstrably better.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-94">
	<li class="s" id="para-94_1">An emphasis on somatic plasticity has additional practical implications, being focused on the functional splitting and joining of agents’ parts.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-94_2">For example, the ancient question of “where does it all come together?” in the brain, with respect to the unified character of consciousness, is one of those pseudo-problems that is dispelled by a framework like <span class="caps">TAME</span> that focuses on multi-scale architecture.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-94_3">How big should a place where it all comes together be? If it can be ∼140 mm wide, then the answer is, the whole brain.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-94_4">One could decide that it should be smaller (the human pineal gland is ∼7 mm wide), but then the question is, why not smaller still—given the cellular components of the pineal (or any piece of the brain) and the molecular organelles inside a pineal gland cell, one would always need to ask “but where does it all come together <i>inside there</i>?” of whatever piece of the brain is taken to be the seat of consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-94_5">The multi-scale nature of biology means that there is no privileged size scale for any homunculus.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-95">
	<li class="s" id="para-95_1">Another important idea with respect to consciousness is “What is it like to be” a given agent (<a href="#B254">Nagel, 1974</a>). Sensory augmentation, neural link technologies, and bioengineering produce tractable model systems in novel cognitive architectures, such as 2-headed planaria where the brains are connected by a central nervous system (<a href="#F7">Figure 7B</a>), to help study the functional aspects of this cognitive re-shuffling.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-95_2"><span class="caps">TAME</span>’s focus on the fact that all cognitive architectures are inevitably composites emphasizes that the parts can be rearranged; thus, the Subject of cognition can change “on the fly,” not merely during evolutionary timescales.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-95_3">Thus, the basic question of philosophy of mind—what’s it like to be animal X (<a href="#B254">Nagel, 1974</a>)—is just a first-order step on a much longer journey.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-95_4">The second-order question is, what’s it like to be a caterpillar, slowly <i>changing</i> into a butterfly as its brain is largely dissolved and reassembled into a different architecture for an animal whose sense organs, effectors, and perhaps overall Umwelt is completely different.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-95_5">All of this raises fascinating issues of first person experience not only in purely biological metamorphoses (such as human patients undergoing stem cell implants into their brains), but also technological hybrids such as brains instrumentized with novel sensory arrays, robotic bodies, software information systems, or brains functionally linked to other brains (<a href="#B375">Warwick et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#B93">Demarse et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#B286">Potter et al., 2003</a>; <a href="#B18">Bakkum et al., 2007a</a>,<a href="#B17">b</a>; <a href="#B353">Tsuda et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#B81">Cohen-Karni et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#B146">Giselbrecht et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#B1">Aaser et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B306">Ricotti et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#B101">Ding et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#B241">Mehrali et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#B9">Anderson et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B10">Ando and Kanzaki, 2020</a>; <a href="#B243">Merritt et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B263">Orive et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B318">Saha et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B103">Dong et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#B208">Li et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#B281">Pio-Lopez, 2021</a>). The developmental approach to the emergence of consciousness on short, ontogenetic timescales complements the related question on phylogenetic timescales, and is likely to be a key component of mature theories in this field.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-96">
	<li class="s" id="para-96_1">Most surprisingly, the plasticity and capacity for bioengineering and chimerization (recombination of biological and engineered parts in novel configurations) erases the sharp divide between first person and third person perspectives.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_2">This has been a fundamental, discrete distinction ever since Descartes, but the capacity for understanding and creating new combinations shows a continuum even in this basic distinction (<a href="#F11">Figure 11</a>). The fact that Selves are not monadic means we can share parts with our subject of inquiry.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_3">If one has to <i>be</i> a system in order to truly know what it’s like to be that system (1st person perspective), this is now possible, to various degrees, by physically merging one’s cognitive architecture with that of another system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_4">Of course, by strongly coupling to another agent, one doesn’t remain the same and experience the other’s consciousness; instead, a new Self is created that is a composite of the two prior individuals and has composite cognition.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_5">This is why consciousness research is distinct in strong degree from other scientific topics.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_6">One can observe gauges and instruments for 3rd-person science and remain the same Self (largely; the results of the observation may introduce small alterations in the cognitive structure). However, data on 1st person experiential consciousness cannot be taken in without fundamentally changing the Self (being an effective homunculus by watching the neuroscience data corresponding to the movies inside the heads of other people is impossible for the same reason that there is no homunculus in each of our heads). The study of consciousness, whether done <i>via</i> scientific tools or <i>via</i> the mind’s own capacity to change itself, inevitably alters the Subject.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_7">Thus, standard (3rd-person) investigations of this process leave open the ancient question as to whether specific upgrades to cognition induce truly discontinuous jumps in consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_8">The <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework is not incompatible with novel discoveries about sharp phase transitions, but it takes the null hypothesis to be continuity, and it remains to be seen whether contrary evidence for truly sharp upgrades in consciousness can be provided.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-96_9">Future, radical brain-computer interfaces in human patients are perhaps one avenue where a subject undergoing such a change can convince themselves, and perhaps others, that a qualitative, not continuous, change in their consciousness had occurred.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="figure" id="figure-11">
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_1"><strong>Figure 11.</strong> Technology reveals gradualism in Descartes’ cut.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_2">The apparent fundamental gulf between first person perspective (what is it like to <i>be</i> a specific Self) and third person perspective (external scientific study of that cognitive system) can be seen to also be a gradual continuum, when modern technology is used to expand heterophenomenology (<a href="#B95">Dennett, 1991</a>). On the left side of the continuum (A) is a traditional 3-rd person scenario of an agent studying another by measuring its physical states: cognitive states can be inferred but not directly experienced (correlates of consciousness), giving rise to the problem of other minds, and a firm distinction between “you” and “me.” However, sensory substitution and augmentation technology now enables the plugging of various peripherals and sensors directly into the nervous system of subjects, and thus it is possible to connect the output of electrophysiology equipment directly into the subject’s brain (B). For example, if the output of a multielectrode array recording neural activity of subject #1 is connected directly to the brainport device (<a href="#B91">Danilov and Tyler, 2005</a>) of subject #2 (e.g., a scientist), this allows #1’s mental states to more directly provide input into #2’s sensory stream.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_3">This can be made even more direct by fusing portions of two brains directly, during embryogenesis, illustrating that the strength of boundaries between “you” and “me” is variable; this configuration may seem far-fetched, but note that it can be readily produced today in animal model systems, and the only barrier to such configurations is ethical, not empirical or logical &lpar;C&rpar;.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_4">It’s critical to note that these fusion experiments are not just aberrant corner cases, because all brains are <i>already</i> fusions of neural modules.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_5">Single subjects’ brains consist of two hemispheres which must communicate to give rise to a coherent, centralized perception of “me” despite being made of communicating parts, and can be dissociated by commissurotomy (D). Indeed, beyond the two hemispheres, any brain is a collective of smaller active subunits (E) that must all communicate as a collection of cells (each neuron is part of the neighboring neural cell’s “external environment”). This gradient of diverse connections, whether electronic or biological, between and within brains and brain components can be reproduced or expanded upon to whatever degree necessary by biological or technological fusion among subjects.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_6">The technological aspect of <span class="caps">TAME</span> is that we must develop frameworks that deal not only with standard embodiments of mind as happened to be produced by the path evolution took through life on Earth, but all logically and empirically possible configurations that could evolve, be designed, or both, whether on Earth or in exobiological contexts.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_7">The hierarchical, not monadic, structure of cognitive substrates means that the relationship between the parts of one Self and that between a Self and an object of external study is a continuum, not a discrete natural kind.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_8">This suggests a key way that actual Consciousness can be studied—by becoming inherently a participant in the experiment, so as to study it from a first-person perspective.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_9">Importantly however, what happens when one fuses cognitive systems with their subject of study is that a new Self appears (a composite cognitive system), showing that the Self can remain invariant while pursuing scientific study of functional cognition and behavior (the left of the spectrum), but essentially must change in order to gain first-hand knowledge of consciousness in other cognitive systems.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-97">
	<li class="s" id="para-97_1">With respect to the question of <i>consciousness per se</i>, as opposed to neural or behavioral correlates of consciousness, we have one major functional tool: general anesthesia.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-97_2">It is remarkable that we can readily induce a state in which all the individual cells are fine and healthy, but the larger Self is simply gone [although, some of the parts can continue to learn during this time (<a href="#B144">Ghoneim and Block, 1997</a>)].</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-97_3">Interestingly, general anesthetics are gap junction blockers (<a href="#B380">Wentlandt et al., 2006</a>): consistent with the cognitive scaling example above, shutting down electrical communication among the cells leads to a disappearance of the higher-level computational layer while the cellular network is disrupted.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-97_4">GJ blockers are used to anesthetize living beings ranging across plants, Hydra, and human subjects (<a href="#B151">Gremiaux et al., 2014</a>). It is amazing that the same Self (with memories and other properties) returns, when the anesthetic is removed.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-97_5">Of course, the Self does not return immediately, as shown by the many hallucinatory (<a href="#B319">Saniova et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#B181">Kelz et al., 2019</a>) experiences of people coming out of general anesthesia—it takes some time for the brain to return to the correct global bioelectric state once the network connections are allowed again (meta-stability) (<a href="#B295">Rabinovich et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, and in line with the proposed isomorphism between cognition and morphogenesis, gap junction blockade has exactly this effect in regeneration: planaria briefly treated with GJ blocker regenerate heads of other species, but eventually snap out of it and remodel back to their correct target morphology (<a href="#B112">Emmons-Bell et al., 2015</a>). It is no accident that the same reagents cause drastic changes in the high-level Selves in both behavioral and morphogenetic contexts: evolution uses the same scheme (GJ-mediated bioelectrical networks) to implement both.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-99_5"><span class="caps">TAME</span> is definitely incompatible with binary views that cut off consciousness at a particular sharp line and it suggests no obvious way to define cognitive systems that have no consciousness whatsoever.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-100_3">Modern theories of Mind must eventually handle the entire option space for intelligent agents, which not only contains the familiar advanced animals we see on Earth, but can also subsume ones consisting of radically different materials, ones created by synthetic bioengineering or combinations of evolution and rational design in the lab, and ones of exobiological as well as possible terrestrial origins.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-100_4">The advances of engineering confirm and put into practice an idea that was already entailed by evolution: that cognitive traits, like all other traits, evolved from humbler variants, forming a continuum.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-100_6">Take the prevalent legal definition of human “adults,” who snap into being at the age of 18; such binary views on cognitive properties are fictitious coarse-grainings useful for our legal system to operate, but no more than that.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-100_8">The error of “committing Anthropomorphism” is a pseudo-scientific “folk” notion useful for only the most trivial examples of failure to scale down complex claims proportionally to simpler systems; engineering requires us to determine what level of cognitive model enables the most fruitful prediction and control.</li>

It will be critical to more rigorously develop the waypoints along the Persuadability Continuum, including understanding of what an “increased capacity” human (or non-human) would be like, in contrast to the “diminished capacity” with which we are well familiar from legal proceedings [the right side of the continuum, corresponding to radically expanded cognitive light cones (<a href="#B320">Śāntideva Bstan ’dzin rgya m and Comité de traduction Padmakara, 2006</a>)].</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-105_3">This, in Dennett’s phrase, has been achieved until now <i>via</i> high levels of “competency without comprehension” (<a href="#B96">Dennett, 2017</a>); however, we are now moving into a phase in which we create beings <i>via</i> comprehension—with rational control over their structure and cognitive capacities, which brings additional responsibility.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_4">A new ethical framework will have to be formed without reliance on binary folk notions such as “machine,” “robot,” “evolved,” “designed,” etc., because these categories are now seen to not be crisp natural kinds.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_5">Instead, wider approaches (such as Buddhist concern for all sentient beings) may be needed to act ethically with respect to agents that have preferences, goals, concerns, and cognitive capacity in very unfamiliar guises.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_6"><span class="caps">TAME</span> seeks to break through the biases around contingent properties that drive our estimates of who or what deserves proper treatment, to develop a rational, empirically-based mechanism for recognizing Selves around us.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-106">
	<li class="s" id="para-106_1">Another aspect of ethics is the discussion of limits on technology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_2">Much of it is often driven by a mindset of making sure we don’t run afoul of the risks of negative uses of specific technologies (e.g., genetically-modified organisms in ecosystems). This is of course critical with respect to the new bioengineering capabilities.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_3">However, such discussions often are one-sided, framed as if the <i>status quo</i> was excellent, and our main goal is simply to not make things worse.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_4">This is a fundamental error which neglects the opportunity cost of failing to fully exploit the technologies which could drive advances in the control of biology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_5">The <i>status quo</i> is not perfect—society faces numerous problems including disparities of quality of life across the globe, incredible suffering from unsolved medical needs, climate change, etc.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_6">It must be kept in mind that along with the need to limit negative consequences of scientific research, there is a <i>moral imperative</i> to advance aspects of research programs that will (for example) enable the cracking of the morphogenetic code to revolutionize regenerative medicine far beyond what genomic editing and stem cell biology can do alone (<a href="#B196">Levin, 2011</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-107">
	<li class="s" id="para-107_1">The focus on risk arises from a feeling that we should not “mess with nature,” as if the existing structures (from anatomical order to ecosystems) are ideal, and our fumbling attempts will disrupt their delicate balance.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-107_2">While being very careful with powerful advances, it must also be kept in mind that existing balance (i.e., the homeostatic goals of systems from cells to species in the food web) was not achieved by optimizing happiness or any other quality commensurate with modern values: it is the result of dynamical systems properties shaped by the frozen accidents of the meanderings of the evolutionary process and the harsh process of selection for survival capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-107_3">We have the opportunity to use rational design to do better than the basic mechanisms of evolution allow.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-108">
	<li class="s" id="para-108_1">Importantly, current technologies are forcing us to confront an existential risk.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-108_2">Swarm robotics, Internet of Things, AI, and similar engineering efforts are going to be creating numerous complex, goal-driven systems made up of competent parts.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-108_5">To avoid the Skynet scenario (<a href="#B50">Bostrom, 2015</a>), it is imperative to study the scaling of cognition in diverse substrates, so that we can ensure that the goals of powerful, distributed novel beings align with ours.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-109">
	<li class="s" id="para-109_1">Given the ability of human subunits to merge into even larger (social) structures, how do we construct higher-order Selves that promote flourishing for all? The multicellularity-cancer dynamic (<a href="#F9">Figure 9</a>) suggests that tight functional connections that blur cognitive boundaries among subunits is a way to increase cooperation and cognitive capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_2">However, simply maximizing loss of identity into massive collectivism is a well-known failure at the social level, always resulting in the same dynamic: the goals of the whole diverge sharply from those of the parts, which become as disposable to the larger social Self as shed skin cells are to us.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_3">Thus, the goal of this research program beyond biology is the search for optimal binding policies between subunits, which optimize the tradeoffs needed to maximize individual goals and well-being (preserving freedom or empowerment) while reaping the benefits of a scaled-up Self at the level of groups and entire societies.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_4">While the specific binding mechanisms used by evolution are not guaranteed to be the policies we want at the social level, the study of these are critical for jump-starting a rigorous program of research into possible ways of scaling that could have social relevance.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_5">These issues have been previously addressed in the context of evolutionary dynamics and game theory (<a href="#B228">Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995</a>; <a href="#B244">Michod and Nedelcu, 2003</a>; <a href="#B362">Van Baalen, 2013</a>), but can be significantly expanded using the <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-110">
	<li class="s" id="para-110_1">In the end, important ethical questions around novel agents made of combinations of hardware, software, evolved, and designed components always come back to the nature of the Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_2">The coherence of a mind, along with its ability to pursue goal-directed activity, is central to our notions of moral responsibility in the legal sense: diminished capacity, and soon, enhanced capacity, to make <i>choices</i> is a pillar for social structures.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_3">Mechanist views of cause and effect in the neuroscience of behavior have been said to erode these classical notions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_4">Rather than reduce Selves (to 0, in some eliminativist approaches), <span class="caps">TAME</span> (<a href="#B201">Levin, 2022</a>) finds novel Selves all around us.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_5">We see more agency, not less, when evolution and cell biology are taken seriously (<a href="#B202">Levin and Dennett, 2020</a>). The cognitive Self is not an illusion; what is an illusion is that there is only one, permanent, privileged Self that has to arise entirely bottom-up through the hill-climbing process of evolution.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_6">Our goal, at the biomedical, personal, and social levels should not be to destroy or minimize the Self but to recognize it in all its guises, understand its transitions, and enlarge its cognitive capacity toward the well-being of other Selves.<br />
h2(#glossary). Glossary</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-1">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-1_1">The following definitions of terms used in this paper (in alphabetical order) represent ways of thinking about specific terminology in the context of the proposed <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-1_2">These terms have many definitions in other frameworks and are tightly interwoven, and it is likely impossible to do them full justice at this point in time (or provide uncontroversial definitions that everyone will agree capture everything of importance). Moreover, much like a theorem and its component statements, the utility of these highly-related concepts is maximized by the entire set taken together, not by crisp demarcations of any one term.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-1_3">The below definitions are not claimed to be uniquely correct, but merely useful; this field is still sufficiently young with respect to very basic questions, which excessively sharp definitions can limit more than they enable.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-agency">Agency</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-2">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-2_1">a set of properties closely related to decision-making and adaptive action which determine the degree to which optimal ways to relate to the system (in terms of communication, prediction, and control) require progressively higher-level models specified in terms of scale of goals, stresses, capabilities, and preferences of that System as an embodied Self acting in various problem spaces.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-2_2">This view of agency is related to those of autopoiesis (<a href="#B226">Maturana and Varela, 1980</a>) and anticipatory systems (<a href="#B313">Rosen, 1985</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-consciousness">Consciousness</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-3">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-3_1">the first-person phenomenal experience of any Self&#8212;that which makes <i>my toothache</i> irreducibly different to me than anyone else&#8217;s toothache or third-person descriptions of toothaches.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-3_2">The degree and content of consciousness is &#8220;what it is like&#8221; to be that Self, as opposed to studying it from the outside, whether or not the Self is advanced enough to be able to verbalize it or to think about it (<a href="#B254">Nagel, 1974</a>). Consciousness here is not meant to necessarily indicate advanced, reflexive, verbal self-consciousness but rather the basal sentience (sense-process-respond loop) which is taken to be a continuum.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-3_3">Moreover, because all cognitive agents are inevitably made of parts, we are all collective intelligences in a strong sense (<a href="#B326">Schwitzgebel, 2015</a>)--what it is like to be you is exactly what it&#8217;s like to be a (particularly organized) collection of cells.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-cognition">Cognition</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-4">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-4_1">all of the activities undertaken by a Self, at whatever scale and of whatever material implementation, that underlie its gathering, processing, and acting on information for the purposes of adaptive action and perdurance against dissipation.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-4_2">Components include active inference, learning, and basal goal-directed activity, as well as complex cognitive skills such as symbolic reasoning, composition of concepts, language, and meta-cognition.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-decision">Decision</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-5">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-5_1">an event during the traversal of some relevant space by a system&#8217;s state which is efficiently modeled as a choice between diverse options.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-5_2">The degree of &#8220;decision-making&#8221; of any given system is proportional to the spatio-temporal and complexity distance between the events that eventually gave rise to a specific outcome and the outcome itself.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-5_3">Advanced Selves have inputs to their decision-making machinery that are counterfactual future states.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-5_4">The scale at which one defines appropriate inputs (stimuli) to a system is whatever scale is most efficient for understanding the resulting decisions (<a href="#B259">Noble, 2012</a>; <a href="#B275">Pezzulo and Levin, 2016</a>; <a href="#B121">Flack, 2017</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-mind">Mind</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-6">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-6_1">the functional, dynamic aspect of a Self that results from all of its cognitive and somatic activities, which represents the propensities for certain types of actions and possesses some degree of sentience as a first-person perspective that perdures across changes in the material components of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-intelligence">Intelligence</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-7">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-7_1">the functional ability to solve problems in various spaces (not necessarily in 3D space), not tied to specific implementations, anatomical structures, or time scales.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-7_2">The degree of intelligence (IQ) is proportional to competency in navigating these spaces, including especially the ability to identify paths that temporarily lead further from the goal state but eventually enable better results.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-7_3">Advanced intelligence exploits additional levels of self-modeling which enables multiple levels of virtual modeling of the Self and its outside world (counterfactual thought), anxiety, and creativity (identifying opportunities, as opposed to only solving problems existing right now). In particular, by focusing on the functional aspects of intelligence, and by recognizing that there is no intelligent agent that is not made of parts, Collective Intelligence is generalized here (emphasizing the architecture of functional connections between subunits) and is not viewed as a radically distinct natural kind.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-maslow">Maslow&#8217;s s Hierarchy of Needs</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-8">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-8_1">a motivational theory of psychology that focuses on the relative types of preferences and goals which human (or other) systems pursue at various stages and scales of observation (<a href="#B225">Maslow, 1943</a>). It also stresses degrees of integration and the modulation of higher levels by the level of stress in subunits.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-self">Self</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-9">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-9_1">a coherent system emerging within a set of integrated parts that serves as the functional owner of associations, memories, and preferences, and acts to accomplish goals in specific problem spaces where those goals belong to the collective and not to any individual sub-component.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-9_2">Selves are defined by the spatio-temporal scale and nature of the types of goals they can pursue&#8212;their &#8220;cognitive light cone.&#8221; They have functional boundaries and material implementations but are not identical with any specific type of substrate, and can overlap within other Selves at the same, higher, and lower-level Selves.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-9_3">A Self is a theoretical construct posited by external systems (such as scientists, engineers, and conspecifics) and by systems themselves (<i>via</i> internal self-models), which facilitates prediction and adaptive behavior by serving as an efficient, high-level target for intervention and control strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glossary-stress">Stress</h4>
<ul class="p" id="glossary-10">
	<li class="s" id="glossary-10_1">a system-level state which serves as a driver for homeostatic loops (operating over a variable that is progressively reduced as activity gets the system closer to its desired region of action space). The spatio-temporal and complexity scale of events that can possibly stress a system are a good indicator of that system&#8217;s cognitive sophistication.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-10_2">Stress can arise <i>via</i> discord between external states and the Self&#8217;s needs, between sensory stimuli and expectations, or between the goals of multiple subsystems within an agent, either within or across levels of organization.</li>
	<li class="s" id="glossary-10_3">Thus, geometric frustration (<a href="#B317">Sadoc and Mosseri, 2007</a>) and material scientists; notions of stress as a high-level determinant of system behavior over time (<a href="#B28">Batterman and Rice, 2014</a>; <a href="#B27">Batterman, 2015</a>) are minimal examples of the fundamental concept of Stress, on the same continuum as metabolic stress in bacteria, competing cellular alignment forces in planar polarity of tissues, and &#8220;true psychological stress&#8221; in organisms.</li>
