<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<ul class="p" id="para-1">
	<li class="s" id="para-1_1">All known cognitive agents are collective intelligences, because we are all made of parts; biological agents in particular are not just structurally modular, but made of parts that are themselves agents in important ways.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_2">There is no truly monadic, indivisible yet cognitive being: all known minds reside in physical systems composed of components of various complexity and active behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_3">However, as human adults, our primary experience is that of a centralized, coherent Self which controls events in a top-down manner.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_4">That is also how we formulate models of learning <span class="paren">(“the <i>rat</i> learned X”)</span>, moral responsibility, decision-making, and valence: at the center is a subject which has agency, serves as the locus of rewards and punishments, possesses <span class="paren">(as a single functional unit)</span> memories, exhibits preferences, and takes actions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_5">And yet, under the hood, we find collections of cells which follow low-level rules <i>via</i> distributed, parallel functionality and give rise to emergent system-level dynamics.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_6">Much as single celled organisms transitioned to multicellularity during evolution, the single cells of an embryo construct <i>de novo</i>, and then operate, a unified Self during a single agent’s lifetime.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_7">The compound agent supports memories, goals, and cognition that belongs to that Self and not to any of the parts alone.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_8">Thus, one of the most profound and far-reaching questions is that of scaling and unification: how do the activities of competent, lower-level agents give rise to a multiscale holobiont that is truly more than the sum of its parts?</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-1_9">And, given the myriad of ways that parts can be assembled and relate to each other, is it possible to define ways in which truly diverse intelligences can be recognized, compared, and understood?</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-2">
	<li class="s" id="para-2_1">Here, I develop a framework to drive new theory and experiment in biology, cognition, evolution, and biotechnology from a multi-scale perspective on the nature and scaling of the cognitive Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_2">An important part of this research program is the need to encompass beings beyond the familiar conventional, evolved, static model animals with brains.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_3">The gaps in existing frameworks, and thus opportunities for fundamental advances, are revealed by a focus on plasticity of existing forms, and the functional diversity enabled by chimeric bioengineering.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_4">To illustrate how this framework can be applied to unconventional substrates, I explore a deep symmetry between behavior and morphogenesis, deriving hypotheses for dynamics that up- and down-scale Selves within developmental and phylogenetic timeframes, and at the same time strongly impact the speed of the evolutionary process itself <span class="paren">(<a href="#B106">Dukas, 1998</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-2_5">I attempt to show how anatomical homeostasis can be viewed as the result of the behavior of the swarm intelligence of cells, and provides a rich example of how an inclusive, forward-looking technological framework can connect philosophical questions with specific empirical research programs.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-3">
	<li class="s" id="para-3_1">The philosophical context for the following perspective is summarized in <a href="#T1">Table 1</a> <span class="paren">(see also <a href="#S12">Glossary</a>)</span>, and links tightly to the field of basal cognition <span class="paren">(<a href="#B38">Birch et al., 2020</a>)</span> <i>via</i> a fundamentally gradualist approach.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_2">It should be noted that the specific proposals for biological mechanisms that scale functional capacity are synergistic with, but not linearly dependent on, this conceptual basis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_3">The hypotheses about how bioelectric networks scale cell computation into anatomical homeostasis, and the evolutionary dynamics of multi-scale competency, can be explored without accepting the “minds everywhere” commitments of the framework.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-3_4">However, together they form a coherent lens onto the life sciences which helps generate testable new hypotheses and integrate data from several subfields.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="table" id="table-1">
	<li class="s" id="table-1_1"><strong><span class="caps">TABLE</span> 1.</strong> The core tenets of <span class="caps">TAME</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_2">Continuum of cognitive capacities  <span class="paren">— no binary categories, no bright line separating true cognition from &#8220;just physics,&#8221; as is clear from evolutionary process and ability to bioengineer chimeras between any two &#8220;natural kinds.</span> &#8220;</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_3">Mature frameworks must apply to truly diverse intelligences  <span class="paren">— beyond the examples from Earth&#8217;s phylogenetic tree based on brains, we must be able to consider and compare agents across the option space of designed and evolved combinations of living, non-living, and software components at all scales.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_4">Selves exist across a continuum of persuadability, and it is an empirical question as to where on this axis any given system lies <span class="paren">(revealed by the ratio of prediction and control vs. effort and knowledge that needs to be input, for any given way of relating to that system)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_5">Selves are not fixed, permanent agents  <span class="paren">— their substrate can remodel radically during their lifetime; the owner of memories and preferences, and the subject that interprets rewards and punishments, is malleable and plastic.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_6">The core of being a Self is the ability to pursue goals. Selves can be nested and overlapping, cooperating and competing both laterally and across levels.  Each higher-level self deforms the option space for the lower level Selves, enabling them to follow energy minimization to achieve outcomes that look inevitable and simple at one scale, while serving intelligent goals at a higher scale.</li>
	<li class="s" id="table-1_7">Intelligence is the degree of competency of navigating any space <span class="paren">(not just the familiar 3D space of motility)</span>, including morphospace, transcriptional space, physiological space, etc., toward desirable regions, while avoiding being trapped in local minima. Estimates of intelligence of any system are observer-dependent, and say as much about the observer and their limitations as they do about the system itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-4">
	<li class="s" id="para-4_1">For the purposes of this paper, “cognition” refers not only to complex, self-reflexive advanced cognition or metacognition, but is used in the less conservative sense that recognizes many diverse capacities for learning from experience <span class="paren">(<a href="#B145">Ginsburg and Jablonka, 2021</a>)</span>, adaptive responsiveness, self-direction, decision-making in light of preferences, problem-solving, active probing of their environment, and action at different levels of sophistication in conventional <span class="paren">(evolved)</span> life forms as well as bioengineered ones <span class="paren">(<a href="#B314">Rosenblueth et al., 1943</a>; <a href="#B214">Lyon, 2006</a>; <a href="#B29">Bayne et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#B206">Levin et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#B216">Lyon et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-4_2">For our purposes, cognition refers to the functional computations that take place between perception and action, which allow the agent to span a wider range of time <span class="paren">(<i>via</i> memory and predictive capacity, however much it may have)</span>  than its immediate <i>now</i>, which enable it to generalize and infer patterns from instances of stimuli <span class="paren">—precursors to more advanced forms of recombining concepts, language, and logic.</span></li>

(1943)</a>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-1_4">&lpar;C&rpar; At each layer of a given biosystem, novel components can be introduced of either biological or engineered origin, resulting in chimeric forms that have novel bodies and novel cognitive systems distinct from the typical model species on the Earth’s phylogenetic lineage.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-5">
	<li class="s" id="para-5_1">The framework, <span class="caps">TAME</span> <span class="paren">—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—</span> adopts a practical, constructive engineering perspective on the optimal place for a given system on the continuum of cognitive sophistication.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_2">This gives rise to an axis of <i>persuadability</i> <span class="paren">(<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>)</span>, which is closely related to the Intentional Stance <span class="paren">(<a href="#B94">Dennett, 1987</a>)</span> but made more explicit in terms of functional engineering approaches needed to implement prediction and control in practice.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_3">Persuadability refers to the type of conceptual and practical tools that are optimal to rationally modify a given system’s behavior.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_4">The origin story <span class="paren">(designed vs. evolved)</span>, composition, and other aspects are not definitive guides to the correct level of agency for a living or non-living system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-5_5">Instead, one must perform experiments to see which kind of intervention strategy provides the most efficient prediction and control <span class="paren">(thus, one aim should be generalizing the human-focused Turing Test and other IQ metrics into a broader agency detection toolkit, which perhaps could itself be implemented by a useful algorithm)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="figure" id="figure-2">
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_1"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The axis of persuadability.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_2">A proposed way to visualize a continuum of agency, which frames the problem in a way that is testable and drives empirical progress, is <i>via</i> an “axis of persuadability”: to what level of control <span class="paren">(ranging from brute force micromanagement to persuasion by rational argument)</span> is any given system amenable, given the sophistication of its cognitive apparatus?</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_3">Here are shown only a few representative waypoints.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_4">On the far left are the simplest physical systems, e.g., mechanical clocks (A).</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_5">These cannot be persuaded, argued with, or even rewarded/punished <span class="paren">—only physical hardware-level “rewiring” is possible if one wants to change their behavior.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_6">On the far right (D) are human beings <span class="paren">(and perhaps others to be discovered)</span> whose behavior can be radically changed by a communication that encodes a rational argument that changes the motivation, planning, values, and commitment of the agent receiving this.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_7">Between these extremes lies a rich panoply of intermediate agents, such as simple homeostatic circuits (B) which have setpoints encoding goal states, and more complex systems such as animals which can be controlled by signals, stimuli, training, etc., &lpar;C&rpar;.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_8">They can have some degree of plasticity, memory <span class="paren">(change of future behavior caused by past events)</span>, various types of simple or complex learning, anticipation/prediction, etc.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_9">Modern “machines” are increasingly occupying right-ward positions on this continuum <span class="paren">(<a href="#B47">Bongard and Levin, 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_10">Some may have preferences, which avails the experimenter of the technique of rewards and punishments <span class="paren">—a more sophisticated control method than rewiring, but not as sophisticated as persuasion <span class="paren">(the latter requires the system to be a logical agent, able to comprehend and be moved by arguments, not merely triggered by signals)</span>.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_11">Examples of transitions include turning the sensors of state outward, to include others’ stress as part of one’s action policies, and eventually the meta-goal of committing to enhance one’s agency, intelligence, or compassion <span class="paren">(increase the scope of goals one can pursue)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_12">A more negative example is becoming sophisticated enough to be susceptible to a “thought that breaks the thinker” <span class="paren">(e.g., existential or skeptical arguments that can make one depressed or even suicidal, Gödel paradoxes, etc.)</span>  <span class="paren">—massive changes can be made in those systems by a very low-energy signal because it is treated as information in the context of a complex host computational machinery.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_13">These agents exhibit a degree of multi-scale plasticity that enables informational input to make strong changes in the structure of the cognitive system itself.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_14">The positive flip side of this vulnerability is that it avails those kinds of minds with a long term version of free will: the ability through practice and repeated effort to change their own thinking patterns, responses to stimuli, and functional cognition.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_15">This continuum is not meant to be a linear <i>scala naturae</i> that aligns with any kind of “direction” of evolutionary progress <span class="paren">—evolution is free to move in any direction in this option space of cognitive capacity; instead, this scheme provides a way to formalize <span class="paren">(for a pragmatic, engineering approach)</span> the major transitions in cognitive capacity that can be exploited for increased insight and control.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_16">The goal of the scientist is to find the optimal position for a given system.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_17">Too far to the right, and one ends up attributing hopes and dreams to thermostats or simple AIs in a way that does not advance prediction and control.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_18">Too far to the left, and one loses the benefits of top-down control in favor of intractable micromanagement.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_19">Note also that this forms a continuum with respect to how much knowledge one has to have about the system’s details in order to manipulate its function: for systems in class A, one has to know a lot about their workings to modify them.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_20">For class B, one has to know how to read-write the setpoint information, but does not need to know anything about how the system will implement those goals.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_21">For class C, one doesn’t have to know how the system modifies its goal encodings in light of experience, because the system does all of this on its own <span class="paren">—one only has to provide rewards and punishments.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-2_22">Images by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-6">
	<li class="s" id="para-6_1">Our capacity to find new ways to understand and manipulate complex systems is strongly related to how we categorize agency in our world.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_2">Newton didn’t invent two terms <span class="paren">—gravity <span class="paren">(for terrestrial objects falling)</span>  and perhaps <i>shmavity</i> <span class="paren">(for the moon)</span> —</span> because it would have lost out on the much more powerful unification.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_3"><span class="caps">TAME</span> proposes a conceptual unification that would facilitate porting of tools across disciplines and model systems.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-6_4">We should avoid quotes around mental terms because there is no absolute, binary distinction between <i>it knows</i> and <i>it “knows”</i> <span class="paren">—only a difference in the degree to which a model will be useful that incorporates such components.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-7">
	<li class="s" id="para-7_1">Given this perspective, below I develop hypotheses about invariants that unify otherwise disparate-seeming problems, such as morphogenesis, behavior, and physiological allostasis.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_2">I take goals <span class="paren">(in the cybernetic sense)</span> and stressors <span class="paren">(as a system-level result of distance from one’s goals)</span> as key invariants which allow us to study and compare agents in truly diverse embodiments.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_3">The processes which scale goals and stressors form a positive feedback loop with modularity, thus both arising from, and potentiating the power of, evolution.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_4">These hypotheses suggest a specific way to understand the scaling of cognitive capacity through evolution, make interesting predictions, and suggest novel experimental work.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-7_5">They also provide ways to think about the impending expansion of the “space of possible bodies and minds” <i>via</i> the efforts of bioengineers, which is sure to disrupt categories and conclusions that have been formed in the context of today’s natural biosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-8">
	<li class="s" id="para-8_1">What of consciousness?</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_2">It is likely impossible to understand sentience without understanding cognition, and the emphasis of this paper is on testable, empirical impacts of ways to understand cognition in all of its guises.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_3">By enabling the definition, detection, and comparison of cognition and intelligence, in diverse substrates beyond standard animals, we can enhance the range of embodiments in which sentience may result.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_4">In order to move the field forward <i>via</i> empirical progress, the focus of most of the discussion below is on ways to think about cognitive function, not on phenomenal or access consciousness  <span class="paren">[in the sense of the “Hard Problem” <span class="paren">(<a href="#B70">Chalmers, 2013</a>)</span> ]</span> .</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-8_5">However, I return to this issue at the end, discussing <span class="caps">TAME</span>’s view of sentience as fundamentally tied to goal-directed activity, only some aspects of which can be studied <i>via</i> third person approaches.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-9">
	<li class="s" id="para-9_1">The main goal is to help advance and delineate an exciting emerging field at the intersection of biology, philosophy, and the information sciences.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-9_2">By proposing a new framework and examining it in a broad context of now physically realizable <span class="paren">(not merely logically possible)</span> living structures, it may be possible to bring conceptual, philosophical thought up to date with recent advances in science and technology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-9_3">At stake are current knowledge gaps in evolutionary, developmental, and cell biology, a new roadmap for regenerative medicine, lessons that could be ported to artificial intelligence and robotics, and broader implications for ethics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cognition">Cognition: Changing the Subject</h2>
<ul class="p" id="para-10">
	<li class="s" id="para-10_1">Even advanced animals are really collective intelligences <span class="paren">(<a href="#B85">Couzin, 2007</a>, <a href="#B86">2009</a>; <a href="#B361">Valentini et al., 2018</a>)</span>, exploiting still poorly-understood scaling and binding features of metazoan architectures that share a continuum with looser swarms that have been termed “liquid brains” <span class="paren">(<a href="#B335">Sole et al., 2019</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-10_2">Studies of “centralized control” focus on a brain, which is in effect a network of cells performing functions that many cell types, including bacteria, can do <span class="paren">(<a href="#B182">Koshland, 1983</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-10_3">The embodied nature of cognition means that the minds of Selves are dependent on a highly plastic material substrate which changes not only on evolutionary time scales but also during the lifetime of the agent itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-11">
	<li class="s" id="para-11_1">The central consequence of the composite nature of all intelligences is that the Self is subject to significant change in real-time <span class="paren">(<a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_2">This means both slow maturation through experience <span class="paren">(a kind of “software” change that doesn’t disrupt traditional ways of thinking about agency)</span>, as well as radical changes of the material in which a given mind is implemented <span class="paren">(<a href="#B198">Levin, 2020</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_3">The owner, or subject of memories, preferences, and in more advanced cases, credit and blame, is very malleable.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_4">At the same time, fascinating mechanisms somehow ensure the persistence of Self <span class="paren">(such as complex memories)</span> despite drastic alterations of substrate.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_5">For example, the massive remodeling of the caterpillar brain, followed by the morphogenesis of an entirely different brain suitable for the moth or beetle, does not wipe all the memories of the larva but somehow maps them onto behavioral capacities in the post-metamorphosis host, despite its entirely different body <span class="paren">(<a href="#B7">Alloway, 1972</a>; <a href="#B354">Tully et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#B328">Sheiman and Tiras, 1996</a>; <a href="#B12">Armstrong et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#B299">Ray, 1999</a>; <a href="#B42">Blackiston et al., 2008</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-11_6">Not only that, but memories can apparently persist following the complete regeneration of brains in some organisms <span class="paren">(<a href="#B231">McConnell et al., 1959</a>; <a href="#B83">Corning, 1966</a>; <a href="#B331">Shomrat and Levin, 2013</a>)</span> such as planaria, in which prior knowledge and behavioral tendencies are somehow transferred onto a newly-constructed brain.</li>

	<li class="s" id="para-65_2">When connected to each other <i>via</i> gap junctions, as in metazoan embryos, several things happen <span class="paren">(much of which is familiar to neuroscientists and workers in machine learning in terms of the benefits of neural networks)</span> that lead to the creation of a Self with a new, larger cognitive boundary.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_3">First, when cells join into an electrochemical network, they can now sense events, and act, on a much larger physical “radius of concern” than a single cell.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_4">Moreover, the network can now integrate information coming from spatially disparate regions in complex ways that result in activity in other spatial regions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_5">Second, the network has much more computational power than any of its individual cells <span class="paren">(nodes)</span>, providing an IQ boost for the newly formed Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-65_6">In such networks, Hebbian dynamics on the electrical synapse (GJ) can provide association between action in one location and reward in another, which enables the system to support credit assignment at the level of the larger individual.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-66">
	<li class="s" id="para-66_1">The third consequence of GJ connectivity is the partial dissolution of informational boundaries between the subunits.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_2">GJ-mediated signals are unique because they give each cell immediate access to the internal milieu of other cells.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_3">A conventional secreted biochemical signal arrives from the outside, and when it triggers cell receptors on the surface, the cell clearly knows that this information originated externally <span class="paren">(and can be attended to, ignored, etc.)</span>  <span class="paren">—it is easy to maintain boundary between Self and world.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_4">However, imagine a signal like a calcium spike originating in a cell due to some damage stimulus for example.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_5">When that calcium propagates onto the GJ-coupled neighbor, there are no metadata on that signal marking its origin; the recipient cell only knows that a calcium transient occurred, and cannot tell that this information does not belong to it.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_6">The downstream effects of this second messenger event are a kind of false memory for the recipient cell, but a true memory for the collective network of the stimulus that occurred in one part of the individual.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_7">This wiping of ownership information for GJ signals as they propagate through the network is critical to enabling a partial “mind meld” between the cells: keeping identity <span class="paren">(in terms of distinct individual history of physiological states &lt;span class=&#8220;paren&#8221;&gt;—memory)</span> becomes very difficult, as small informational molecules propagate and mix within the network.&lt;/span&gt;</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_8">Thus, this property of GJ coupling promotes the creation of a larger Self by partially erasing the mnemic boundaries between the parts which might impair their ability to work toward a common goal.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-66_9">This is a key part of the scaling of the Self by enlarging toward common goals <span class="paren">—not by micromanagement, but by bringing multiple subunits into the same goal-directed loop by tightly coupling the sensing, memory, and action steps in a syncytium where all activity is bound toward a system-level teleonomic process.</span></li>

	<li class="s" id="para-68_2">GJ-mediated communications are not merely conversations <span class="paren">(in the way that external signaling is)</span>  <span class="paren">—they are binding, in the sense that once a GJ is open, a cell is subject to whatever comes in from the neighbor.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_3">In the same sense, having a synapse makes one vulnerable to the state of neighbors.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_4">GJs spread <span class="paren">(dilute)</span> the pain of depolarization, but at the same time give a cell’s neighbors the power to change its state.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_5">Compatible with the proposal that the magnitude of a Self is the scale and complexity of states by which it can be stressed, connections by tunable, dynamic GJs greatly expand the spatial, temporal, and complexity of things that can irritate cells; complex events from far away can now percolate into a cell <i>via</i> non-linear GJ paths through the network, and enabling the drive to minimize such events now necessarily involves homeostatic activity of goal states, sensing, and activity on a much larger scale.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_6">Stress signals, propagating through such networks, incentivize other regions of the tissue to act cooperatively in response to <i>distant</i> events by harnessing their selfish drive to reduce their own stress.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_7">This facilitates the coherent, system-level response to perturbations beyond their local consequences, and gives rise to larger Selves able to react coherently to stressful departures from more complex, spatially-distributed allostatic setpoints.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-68_8">For example, whereas a solitary cell might be stressed <span class="paren">(and react to)</span> abnormal local pH, cells that are part of a transplanted salamander limb will be induced to a more grandiose activity: they will change the number of fingers they produce to be correct relative to the limb’s new position in the host’s body <span class="paren">(<a href="#B316">Ruud, 1929</a>)</span>, a decision that involves large-scale sensing, decision-making, and control.</li>

<ul class="p" id="para-91">
	<li class="s" id="para-91_1">While the <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework focuses on 3rd-person observable properties, it does make some commitments to ways of thinking about consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_2">Provisionally, I suggest that consciousness also comes in degrees and kinds <span class="paren">(is not binary)</span> for the same reasons argued for continuity of cognition: if consciousness is fundamentally embodied, the plasticity and gradual malleability of bodies suggests that it is a strong requirement for proponents of phase transitions to specify what kind of “atomic” <span class="paren">(not further divisible)</span> bodily change makes for a qualitative shift in capacity consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_3">Another implication of <span class="caps">TAME</span> is that while “embodiment” is critical for consciousness, it is not restricted to physical bodies acting in 3D space, but also includes perception-action systems working in all sorts of spaces.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_4">This implies, counter to many people’s intuitions, that systems that operate in morphogenetic, transcriptional, and other spaces should also have some <span class="paren">(if very minimal)</span> degree of consciousness.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-91_5">This in turn suggests that an agent, such as a typical modern human, is really a patchwork of many diverse consciousnesses, only one of which is usually capable of verbally reporting its states <span class="paren">(and, not surprisingly, given its limited access and self-boundary, believes itself to be a unitary, sole owner of the body)</span>.</li>

	<li class="s" id="figure-11_3">On the left side of the continuum (A) is a traditional 3-rd person scenario of an agent studying another by measuring its physical states: cognitive states can be inferred but not directly experienced <span class="paren">(correlates of consciousness)</span>, giving rise to the problem of other minds, and a firm distinction between “you” and “me.” However, sensory substitution and augmentation technology now enables the plugging of various peripherals and sensors directly into the nervous system of subjects, and thus it is possible to connect the output of electrophysiology equipment directly into the subject’s brain (B).</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_4">For example, if the output of a multielectrode array recording neural activity of subject #1 is connected directly to the brainport device <span class="paren">(<a href="#B91">Danilov and Tyler, 2005</a>)</span> of subject #2 <span class="paren">(e.g., a scientist)</span>, this allows #1’s mental states to more directly provide input into #2’s sensory stream.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_5">This can be made even more direct by fusing portions of two brains directly, during embryogenesis, illustrating that the strength of boundaries between “you” and “me” is variable; this configuration may seem far-fetched, but note that it can be readily produced today in animal model systems, and the only barrier to such configurations is ethical, not empirical or logical &lpar;C&rpar;.</li>
	<li class="s" id="figure-11_6">It’s critical to note that these fusion experiments are not just aberrant corner cases, because all brains are <i>already</i> fusions of neural modules.</li>

	<li class="s" id="figure-11_11">The hierarchical, not monadic, structure of cognitive substrates means that the relationship between the parts of one Self and that between a Self and an object of external study is a continuum, not a discrete natural kind.</li>

<h3 id="ethics">Beyond Basic Science: Up-to-Date Ethics</h3>
<ul class="p" id="para-104">
	<li class="s" id="para-104_1">The <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework also has implications for ethics in several ways.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-104_2">The current emphasis for ethics is on whether bioengineered constructs <span class="paren">(e.g., neural cell organoids)</span> are sufficiently like a human brain or not <span class="paren">(<a href="#B171">Hyun et al., 2020</a>)</span>, as a criterion for acceptability.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-104_3">Likewise, existing efforts to extend ethics focus on natural, conventional evolutionary products such as invertebrates <span class="paren">(<a href="#B245">Mikhalevich and Powell, 2020</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-104_4"><span class="caps">TAME</span> suggests that this is insufficient, because many different architectures for cognition are possible <span class="paren">(and will be realized)</span>  <span class="paren">—similarity to human brains is too parochial and limiting a marker for entities deserving of protection and other moral considerations.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="para-104_5">We must develop a new ethics that recognizes the diversity of possible minds and bodies, especially since combinations of biological, engineered, and software systems are, and increasingly will be, developed.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-104_6">What something looks like and how it originated <span class="paren">(<a href="#B204">Levin et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#B47">Bongard and Levin, 2021</a>)</span> will no longer be a good guide when we are confronted with a myriad of creatures that cannot be comfortably placed within the familiar Earth’s phylogenetic tree.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-105">
	<li class="s" id="para-105_1">Bioengineering of novel Selves raises our moral responsibility.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_2">For eons, humans have been creating and releasing into the world advanced, autonomous intelligences—<i>via</i> pregnancy and birth of other humans.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_3">This, in Dennett’s phrase, has been achieved until now <i>via</i> high levels of “competency without comprehension” <span class="paren">(<a href="#B96">Dennett, 2017</a>)</span> ; however, we are now moving into a phase in which we create beings <i>via</i> comprehension <span class="paren">—with rational control over their structure and cognitive capacities, which brings additional responsibility.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_4">A new ethical framework will have to be formed without reliance on binary folk notions such as “machine,” “robot,” “evolved,” “designed,” etc., because these categories are now seen to not be crisp natural kinds.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_5">Instead, wider approaches <span class="paren">(such as Buddhist concern for all sentient beings)</span> may be needed to act ethically with respect to agents that have preferences, goals, concerns, and cognitive capacity in very unfamiliar guises.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-105_6"><span class="caps">TAME</span> seeks to break through the biases around contingent properties that drive our estimates of who or what deserves proper treatment, to develop a rational, empirically-based mechanism for recognizing Selves around us.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-106">
	<li class="s" id="para-106_1">Another aspect of ethics is the discussion of limits on technology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_2">Much of it is often driven by a mindset of making sure we don’t run afoul of the risks of negative uses of specific technologies <span class="paren">(e.g., genetically-modified organisms in ecosystems)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_3">This is of course critical with respect to the new bioengineering capabilities.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_4">However, such discussions often are one-sided, framed as if the <i>status quo</i> was excellent, and our main goal is simply to not make things worse.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_5">This is a fundamental error which neglects the opportunity cost of failing to fully exploit the technologies which could drive advances in the control of biology.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_6">The <i>status quo</i> is not perfect <span class="paren">—society faces numerous problems including disparities of quality of life across the globe, incredible suffering from unsolved medical needs, climate change, etc.</span></li>
	<li class="s" id="para-106_7">It must be kept in mind that along with the need to limit negative consequences of scientific research, there is a <i>moral imperative</i> to advance aspects of research programs that will <span class="paren">(for example)</span> enable the cracking of the morphogenetic code to revolutionize regenerative medicine far beyond what genomic editing and stem cell biology can do alone <span class="paren">(<a href="#B196">Levin, 2011</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-107">
	<li class="s" id="para-107_1">The focus on risk arises from a feeling that we should not “mess with nature,” as if the existing structures <span class="paren">(from anatomical order to ecosystems)</span> are ideal, and our fumbling attempts will disrupt their delicate balance.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-107_2">While being very careful with powerful advances, it must also be kept in mind that existing balance <span class="paren">(i.e., the homeostatic goals of systems from cells to species in the food web)</span> was not achieved by optimizing happiness or any other quality commensurate with modern values: it is the result of dynamical systems properties shaped by the frozen accidents of the meanderings of the evolutionary process and the harsh process of selection for survival capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-107_3">We have the opportunity to use rational design to do better than the basic mechanisms of evolution allow.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-108">
	<li class="s" id="para-108_1">Importantly, current technologies are forcing us to confront an existential risk.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-108_2">Swarm robotics, Internet of Things, AI, and similar engineering efforts are going to be creating numerous complex, goal-driven systems made up of competent parts.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-108_3">We currently have no mature science of where the goals of such novel Selves come from.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-108_4"><span class="caps">TAME</span> reminds us that it is essential to understand how goals of composite entities arise and how they can be predicted and controlled.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-108_5">To avoid the Skynet scenario <span class="paren">(<a href="#B50">Bostrom, 2015</a>)</span>, it is imperative to study the scaling of cognition in diverse substrates, so that we can ensure that the goals of powerful, distributed novel beings align with ours.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-109">
	<li class="s" id="para-109_1">Given the ability of human subunits to merge into even larger <span class="paren">(social)</span> structures, how do we construct higher-order Selves that promote flourishing for all?</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_2">The multicellularity-cancer dynamic <span class="paren">(<a href="#F9">Figure 9</a>)</span> suggests that tight functional connections that blur cognitive boundaries among subunits is a way to increase cooperation and cognitive capacity.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_3">However, simply maximizing loss of identity into massive collectivism is a well-known failure at the social level, always resulting in the same dynamic: the goals of the whole diverge sharply from those of the parts, which become as disposable to the larger social Self as shed skin cells are to us.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_4">Thus, the goal of this research program beyond biology is the search for optimal binding policies between subunits, which optimize the tradeoffs needed to maximize individual goals and well-being <span class="paren">(preserving freedom or empowerment)</span> while reaping the benefits of a scaled-up Self at the level of groups and entire societies.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_5">While the specific binding mechanisms used by evolution are not guaranteed to be the policies we want at the social level, the study of these are critical for jump-starting a rigorous program of research into possible ways of scaling that could have social relevance.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-109_6">These issues have been previously addressed in the context of evolutionary dynamics and game theory <span class="paren">(<a href="#B228">Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995</a>; <a href="#B244">Michod and Nedelcu, 2003</a>; <a href="#B362">Van Baalen, 2013</a>)</span>, but can be significantly expanded using the <span class="caps">TAME</span> framework.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="p" id="para-110">
	<li class="s" id="para-110_1">In the end, important ethical questions around novel agents made of combinations of hardware, software, evolved, and designed components always come back to the nature of the Self.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_2">The coherence of a mind, along with its ability to pursue goal-directed activity, is central to our notions of moral responsibility in the legal sense: diminished capacity, and soon, enhanced capacity, to make <i>choices</i> is a pillar for social structures.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_3">Mechanist views of cause and effect in the neuroscience of behavior have been said to erode these classical notions.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_4">Rather than reduce Selves <span class="paren">(to 0, in some eliminativist approaches)</span>, <span class="caps">TAME</span> <span class="paren">(<a href="#B201">Levin, 2022</a>)</span> finds novel Selves all around us.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_5">We see more agency, not less, when evolution and cell biology are taken seriously <span class="paren">(<a href="#B202">Levin and Dennett, 2020</a>)</span>.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_6">The cognitive Self is not an illusion; what is an illusion is that there is only one, permanent, privileged Self that has to arise entirely bottom-up through the hill-climbing process of evolution.</li>
	<li class="s" id="para-110_7">Our goal, at the biomedical, personal, and social levels should not be to destroy or minimize the Self but to recognize it in all its guises, understand its transitions, and enlarge its cognitive capacity toward the well-being of other Selves.<br />
